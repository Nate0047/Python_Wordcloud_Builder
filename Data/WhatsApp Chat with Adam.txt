09/04/2022, 22:54 - Adam: Oooof... That profile pic 😉
09/04/2022, 22:54 - Rachel: Hahaha thank you very much, that's from my night out in Liverpool 😊
09/04/2022, 22:57 - Adam: Nice outfit
09/04/2022, 22:59 - Rachel: Oh thank you! Thought I'd go all out for the night haha. I did have a nightmare with the shoes I was wearing though, the straps snapped in the ball pit and I had to spend the whole night barefoot which was not great in March 😂
09/04/2022, 23:08 - Adam: You absolute warrior. Freezing cold toes, not good at all 🤣
09/04/2022, 23:19 - Rachel: Hahaha yeah it wasn't great but I powered through 😂 It was great while we were in the bars though, dancing with no shoes on felt so free 😂
09/04/2022, 23:25 - Adam: Sexy, channelling your inner Kate Bush were ya? 😜🤣
10/04/2022, 08:53 - Rachel: Haha yeah that's exactly what I was doing 🤣 Although I'm not sure she had to endure the sticky floor of bars though 😜
10/04/2022, 12:18 - Adam: Ohh I dunno, our Kate looked to be quite the trooper. 🤣
Bet your feet were in agony, bless ya.

I suppose it's a testament to how clean Liverpool's streets are that you could walk around it without shoes. It's one thing that stood out to me when I visited. You're making me all broody for Liverpool again, Rachel. 😫
10/04/2022, 12:23 - Rachel: Hahaha yeah I suppose it was better than if it had happened in Bolton 🤣 Haha you'll have to make another trip!
10/04/2022, 16:30 - Adam: Lmao, hate to think what you'd step on in Bolton... Probably a drunken Adam 👀🤣

I do need to go back, I've got a friend over there I've not seen in aaaages.
10/04/2022, 20:33 - Rachel: Hahaha yeah I get that impression from the stalking I did of your Facebook 😜 Ah yeah that's fair enough! 

So how's your day been?
10/04/2022, 21:49 - Adam: Ooof, you went really deep on your stalking sesh. 😉


Housework and seeing my dad 🤣 

Not nearly as exciting as your day I'm sure, your mum have a nice time?
10/04/2022, 21:50 - Rachel: Haha you have to 😂 Oh nice, I hope your dad's doing okay? Yeah it was really nice thanks! She's had a great day 😊
10/04/2022, 22:15 - Adam: Cheeky girl 😉🤣

He's better than he was, thank you.

Awww bless her, dutiful daughter eh, rachel? 😜
10/04/2022, 22:16 - Rachel: Oh that's really good, I'm glad to hear that. 

Hahaha I like to think so 😜
10/04/2022, 22:18 - Adam: <Media omitted>
10/04/2022, 22:20 - Rachel: Hey 😜
10/04/2022, 22:26 - Adam: Hey 🤣
10/04/2022, 22:30 - Rachel: What are you up to?
10/04/2022, 22:31 - Adam: Just settling down for the night, fresh bedding on in a minute
10/04/2022, 22:31 - Adam: Yourself?
10/04/2022, 22:33 - Rachel: Ooh nice, sounds good. Yeah same really, just watching Derry Girls and then I'm gonna head to bed too
10/04/2022, 22:41 - Adam: In your Jimmy jams? I've heard of it, can't say I've watched it 🤣
10/04/2022, 22:57 - Rachel: Haha I am in my Jimmy jams, just got into bed now 😜 Oh it's amazing, it's so funny! Sort of dry and sarcastic humour, it's so good
10/04/2022, 23:02 - Adam: I can't wear Jammie's, I get too hot Rachel 😜🤣
10/04/2022, 23:04 - Rachel: Haha yeah I know what you mean 😂 I have to just wear a vest top and shorts, or I get too hot as well 😜
10/04/2022, 23:26 - Adam: <Media omitted>
11/04/2022, 07:01 - Rachel: Morning 😊 Sorry, I was asleep when you sent that last picture 😜
11/04/2022, 08:30 - Adam: Don't worry about it, I was only fishing for one back 😉🤣
11/04/2022, 12:26 - Rachel: Hahaha sorry, you missed your chance 😜
11/04/2022, 12:53 - Adam: Absolutely heartbreaking, Rachel. 😑
11/04/2022, 12:55 - Rachel: I was in my pyjamas with no make up on, I'm sure you wouldn't have wanted a picture of that anyway 😜
11/04/2022, 13:08 - Adam: I may prefer the all natural look 😉
11/04/2022, 13:38 - Rachel: Haha do you? Maybe next time 😜
11/04/2022, 14:20 - Adam: Next time 🤣🤣

Seems I'm building quite the collection, I'm now owed a lovebite from hell and a bed selfie. 😜
11/04/2022, 15:51 - Rachel: I'm not committing to the lovebite 😜
11/04/2022, 18:03 - Adam: Grrrr 😑
11/04/2022, 18:16 - Rachel: We'll see how the date goes 😜 Why do you want one so much? 😂
11/04/2022, 18:29 - Adam: Neck kisses of any sort are divine 🤣😫
11/04/2022, 18:30 - Rachel: Oh I definitely agree with that 😂 You can give neck kisses without giving a lovebite though 😜
11/04/2022, 19:06 - Adam: Some of us get a little carried away and passionate in our neck kisses though Rachel. 😉🤣
11/04/2022, 19:08 - Rachel: Hahaha hey I'm not complaining 😂 Just not ideal when you have to try and cover them the next day 😜 Although I suppose guys don't care about that 😂
11/04/2022, 20:37 - Adam: I couldn't give a shit 🤣 I don't get embarrassed by them at all.
11/04/2022, 20:38 - Rachel: I think it depends who you'll be seeing 😜
11/04/2022, 21:28 - Adam: Badge of pride 😑
11/04/2022, 21:28 - Rachel: Haha yeah that's true, show them proudly 😜
11/04/2022, 21:32 - Adam: I'll look forward to it 👀
11/04/2022, 21:32 - Rachel: Well that's a lot of pressure on me now 😂
11/04/2022, 21:34 - Adam: No pressure at all Rach, I assure you.
11/04/2022, 21:35 - Rachel: Hahaha good, I appreciate that
11/04/2022, 23:05 - Rachel: I'm heading off to bed now, do you still want a bedtime selfie? 😜
11/04/2022, 23:06 - Adam: Very much so
11/04/2022, 23:10 - Rachel: <Media omitted>
11/04/2022, 23:13 - Adam: Pretty girl aren't ya
11/04/2022, 23:15 - Adam: <Media omitted>
11/04/2022, 23:17 - Rachel: Oh thank you very much. You got a completely natural selfie there, you said that's what you wanted 😜
11/04/2022, 23:21 - Adam: Certainly did!  I appreciate a girl in glasses 😜
11/04/2022, 23:22 - Rachel: Hahaha thanks, I wasn't sure whether to leave them on 😜
11/04/2022, 23:24 - Adam: Put a lot of thought into it did ya? 😉
11/04/2022, 23:25 - Rachel: That was pretty much the extent of it, don't be thinking I was agonising over it too much 😜
11/04/2022, 23:31 - Adam: Shush, button nose 😜
11/04/2022, 23:33 - Rachel: I'm sorry, what? 😂
11/04/2022, 23:35 - Adam: You've got a cute nose 🤣🤣
11/04/2022, 23:36 - Rachel: No one's ever said that to me before but I'll take it, thanks 🤣
11/04/2022, 23:38 - Adam: I'll freely admit I'm a strange one 🤣
11/04/2022, 23:39 - Rachel: Haha it's good that you admit it 🤣
11/04/2022, 23:39 - Rachel: I'm gonna get some sleep now because I've got work in the morning. So goodnight!
11/04/2022, 23:40 - Adam: Mhmm, sleep well
11/04/2022, 23:40 - Rachel: You too
11/04/2022, 23:41 - Adam: <Media omitted>
12/04/2022, 07:31 - Rachel: Morning 😊 I'd already turned my WiFi off by that point 😜
12/04/2022, 07:54 - Adam: Morning, beaut.

And how dare! 🤣😜
12/04/2022, 07:55 - Rachel: I mean, I did tell you I was going to sleep so that's on you 😜
12/04/2022, 08:18 - Adam: There's going to sleep and then there's switching me off, tsk. 😉🤣🤣
12/04/2022, 08:35 - Rachel: Yeah you'd better get used to that. When I say I'm going to sleep, I mean right that very second 😜
12/04/2022, 11:09 - Adam: Ruthlessly shutting my ass down, oooof 😉🤣
12/04/2022, 11:11 - Rachel: I know, how rude of me 😜
12/04/2022, 11:43 - Adam: Naughty even
12/04/2022, 11:45 - Rachel: I gave you enough warning that I was wanting to go to sleep, that's on you 🤷‍♀️
12/04/2022, 11:58 - Adam: 😒😉
12/04/2022, 11:59 - Rachel: Hahaha 😂 

What are you up to today?
12/04/2022, 13:00 - Adam: Dad's been discharged, so I'll be getting him settled. Stress!
12/04/2022, 13:00 - Rachel: Oh that's great that he's being discharged! Is he coming to stay with you?
12/04/2022, 13:22 - Adam: Kind of, I don't think he was ready to be honest.

And yeah he will be.
12/04/2022, 13:35 - Rachel: Oh really? Well I hope you manage to get him settled with you
12/04/2022, 17:12 - Adam: You're a sweetheart
12/04/2022, 17:22 - Rachel: Oh well thank you, I try haha. How is he?
12/04/2022, 18:35 - Adam: Difficult 🤣🤦 

It's a long story, I'll prolly tell you Friday.
12/04/2022, 18:35 - Rachel: Oh yeah that's fine! Hope he's okay though
12/04/2022, 22:44 - Adam: Not being ignorant, just one of those days. Hope you had a good 'un!
13/04/2022, 07:32 - Rachel: Oh no of course, I didn't think you were being ignorant! It was okay thanks, I just worked from home and then went to the cinema with one of my friends last night
13/04/2022, 11:41 - Adam: Ohhh aye yeah. You live next to Cineworld. What did you watch
13/04/2022, 11:45 - Rachel: Yeah my flat's not right next to it but it's pretty close, me and my friend both have cinema cards so we try to go once a week if we can! We went to watch the new Sonic film. It was mainly full of kids but it was great 😂
13/04/2022, 13:25 - Adam: Sounds like there were 2 big kids in there with 'em 😉🤣🤣
13/04/2022, 13:27 - Rachel: Haha yeah 100%, that's the best way 😜 What sort of movies are you into?
13/04/2022, 14:13 - Adam: I'm a total dork, I like sci-fi, history films etc. Keep meaning to watch Dune because I loved the awful 80s version that lynch disowned. Got it downloaded just haven't got around to it. 🤣

Anything with Leonardo DiCaprio in it is pretty solid these days.

Honestly I can watch anything except Adam Sandler shite. I have a mild tolerance for Marvel capeshit as well 🤣
13/04/2022, 14:18 - Rachel: Ooh yeah those are good choices. What did you think of Don't look Up with Leonardo DiCaprio? 

I'll watch pretty much anything too, I'm really big into movies. The only thing I don't like is anything too violent - if it's a film that's just got a bit of violence in it, I'll just hide during those parts 😂

Oh I love Marvel! Do you like Harry Potter?
13/04/2022, 14:32 - Adam: I didn't know he was in it 🤣 would you recommend it?

Aww, how adorable are you? 
So if we're watching a violent film does that mean you're gonna end up on my lap for comfort? 😉🤣

See I'm opposite, the more gritty and violent the better 🤣

You'll hate me, I've never seen the Harry potter's, I was more into lord of the rings. 🤣
13/04/2022, 14:35 - Rachel: Oh yeah I really enjoyed it! It's on Netflix, you should definitely watch it. 

Hahaha my friend that I go to the cinema with is the same as me so we just hide together if we're watching something violent 😂 Her boyfriend sometimes comes with us and he just looks at us like we're weird 🤣

What?? Well we are changing that immediately! If you like Lord of the rings, you have to watch Harry Potter!
13/04/2022, 14:44 - Adam: Ooooof, I might hold you to that Rachel 😉🤣 but yeah I adore the Lord of the rings trilogy. Fellowship of the ring especially.

You hide with horrors then I'm guessing? 🤣
13/04/2022, 14:52 - Rachel: Yeah I've only seen lord of the rings once and I wasn't that keen but my friends made me watch them all in a day so it was a bit much 😂

No weirdly, I actually like horrors! It's just fighting that I don't really like or anything too gruesome 😂 I do love horrors but I am the jumpiest person you'll ever meet. Like if someone at work comes up and starts talking to me but I don't know they're there, I'll jump a mile. So that's not great when watching horrors 🤣
13/04/2022, 16:11 - Adam: Yeah, a marathon like that is mental 🤣🤣🤦

Ooof, I'm genuinely curious to see just how bad you are, now. 😜
13/04/2022, 16:46 - Rachel: Yeah it was a lot and I did not have a good time 😂 Oh it's ridiculous 🤦‍♀️It's become a bit of a thing now on my team, this one guy will always try and see if he can make me jump 😂
13/04/2022, 19:15 - Adam: Someone trying to make me jump would seriously wind me up 🤣🤣
13/04/2022, 19:21 - Rachel: Hahaha yeah it's very annoying and he's always so proud of himself when it works 🤣🤣 We'll have to watch a horror film sometime and you can see how bad it is 😜
13/04/2022, 19:39 - Adam: <Media omitted>
13/04/2022, 19:41 - Rachel: Hahaha good - first a Harry Potter marathon and then horror films 😜
13/04/2022, 22:51 - Adam: Sounds good to me!
13/04/2022, 22:52 - Rachel: Haha it's a plan 😂 How's your night been?
13/04/2022, 22:55 - Adam: It's been alright love, just a quiet one. Will be getting in bed in a min
13/04/2022, 22:56 - Rachel: Oh that's good! Yeah I probably will too - night then 😊
13/04/2022, 22:57 - Adam: Surprised you're not already snuggled up!
13/04/2022, 22:58 - Rachel: Hahaha unfortunately not, I've been at my mum's and only got back about half an hour ago. I will be getting snuggled up soon though 😜
13/04/2022, 23:02 - Adam: Awww that's nice, she doing good?

Snug, hair down, jammies on, toes all toasty and warm 😎😜
13/04/2022, 23:03 - Rachel: Yeah she's good thanks! Had some tea with her so it's always nice to get out of cooking for a night 😜 Hahaha that's exactly the plan 🤣
13/04/2022, 23:07 - Adam: Sounds like the best of evenings.

Good girl, I take it you love your cuddles and being comfy then?
13/04/2022, 23:17 - Rachel: Yeah of course, who doesn't love cuddles and being comfy? 😜
13/04/2022, 23:25 - Adam: Mhmm, wrapped up and toasty in bed. Maybe even a bit of footsie under the sheets. That's the good shit in life. 🤣
13/04/2022, 23:26 - Rachel: Hahaha the perfect night in 🤣
13/04/2022, 23:30 - Adam: <Media omitted>
13/04/2022, 23:33 - Rachel: Are you wanting me to send one back because I probably don't look great right now 😜
13/04/2022, 23:34 - Adam: 😉
13/04/2022, 23:35 - Rachel: Is that a yes? 😜
13/04/2022, 23:35 - Adam: 😉
13/04/2022, 23:37 - Rachel: <Media omitted>
13/04/2022, 23:38 - Adam: ...damn 

What on earth made you think you didn't look good?
13/04/2022, 23:39 - Rachel: Oh well thank you very much 😊 Mainly because I have messy hair and no make up 😜
13/04/2022, 23:44 - Adam: And here I was thinking you look great 😜🤣

How's the neck? 😉
13/04/2022, 23:45 - Rachel: Oh well I appreciate that, thank you 😁 So do you. 

Hahaha much better now thanks 🤣 They faded pretty quickly, thankfully 😜
13/04/2022, 23:48 - Adam: The next one's won't fade so fast 😉🤣
13/04/2022, 23:49 - Rachel: Haha have I set a challenge for you here? 🤣
13/04/2022, 23:52 - Adam: Ohh love, most definitely 🤣
13/04/2022, 23:53 - Rachel: I mean, I had to go into the office on Monday so I didn't really mind that they'd faded 😂
13/04/2022, 23:56 - Adam: I do get a bit... excessive 🤣
13/04/2022, 23:58 - Rachel: Haha yeah I think we maybe got carried away a bit 🤣
14/04/2022, 00:02 - Adam: Needed rescuing didn't you Rachel 😉🔥
14/04/2022, 00:06 - Rachel: Hahaha I think I was doing okay, I was happy not to be rescued 😜
14/04/2022, 00:15 - Adam: Sexy little thing aren't ya 😉🤣
14/04/2022, 00:16 - Rachel: Hahaha thank you very much 🤣
14/04/2022, 00:19 - Rachel: I must go to sleep now though, I'm gonna be very tired for work in the morning 😜
14/04/2022, 00:19 - Adam: I apologise for keeping you up. Just noticed the time 🤣
14/04/2022, 00:19 - Adam: Ahaha
14/04/2022, 00:20 - Rachel: Haha that's fine, I'll let you off 🤣 Night x
14/04/2022, 00:20 - Adam: Good night love
14/04/2022, 00:20 - Adam: 😉
14/04/2022, 07:31 - Rachel: You need to stop sending me messages after I've said I'm going to sleep, I can guarantee my WiFi will be switched off 😜
14/04/2022, 10:58 - Adam: You've prolly noticed I get really carried away  😉🤣
14/04/2022, 10:59 - Rachel: Hahaha that's fine by me 🤣 Just as long as you know that if I seem like I'm ignoring you, I'm probably sleeping 😜
14/04/2022, 11:01 - Adam: Ohh I knew, don't worry about it love. 😝
14/04/2022, 11:02 - Rachel: Hahaha that's good then 😂 How are you today?
14/04/2022, 15:52 - Adam: I've been good, just busy with my dad. How are you? As pretty as ever? 😉
14/04/2022, 16:00 - Rachel: Awww how is he? Yeah I'm okay thanks. Just been working from home, had quite a lot to do before I finish for the long weekend but I'm logging off now! Hahah I don't know about that 😂
14/04/2022, 19:40 - Adam: You looking forward to your long weekend, Rach? 😉
14/04/2022, 19:40 - Rachel: Haha yeah I can't wait 😜 So what time do you want to meet tomorrow?
14/04/2022, 19:41 - Adam: I'll ring you tonight
14/04/2022, 19:41 - Rachel: Yeah no worries. I'll try and prepare myself so I'm not as awkward as last time 😂
14/04/2022, 19:42 - Adam: 🤣🤣 you weren't awkward at all, just adorable
14/04/2022, 19:42 - Rachel: Hahaha thanks, I'll take that 🤣🤣
14/04/2022, 22:19 - Adam: 😜
14/04/2022, 22:19 - Adam: Just getting ready for bed.
14/04/2022, 22:25 - Rachel: Ooh nice. I'm just watching Bridgerton so not cosy in bed yet 😜
14/04/2022, 22:28 - Adam: Binge watching it or is it a weekly thing?
14/04/2022, 22:29 - Rachel: It's on Netflix, have you not heard of it? I'm surprised, it's everywhere 😂
14/04/2022, 22:30 - Adam: I had to search it 🤣🤣😎
14/04/2022, 22:32 - Rachel: Hahaha I wouldn't have expected you to watch it, it's a period drama which is pretty much just about romance but it's so good 😂
14/04/2022, 22:39 - Adam: Like a bit of romance do ya?
14/04/2022, 22:41 - Rachel: Haha yeah I love a good romance
14/04/2022, 23:02 - Adam: So what's so good about this show then anyway? 🤣
14/04/2022, 23:05 - Rachel: Everything! The beautiful costumes, the scenery, the romance. What more do you need? 😂
14/04/2022, 23:12 - Adam: Good writing? 🤣
14/04/2022, 23:14 - Rachel: Hmm I guess it has that too 😜 It's set in the 1800s so it's a lot of period talk and men saying things they'd never say in real life, if that counts as good writing? 🤣
14/04/2022, 23:21 - Adam: Regency era... Oh god
14/04/2022, 23:25 - Rachel: Oh yeah it's basically just women in corset dresses and men declaring their love in very extra and dramatic ways, it's great 😜
14/04/2022, 23:29 - Adam: See, corsets and stockings I can work with
14/04/2022, 23:30 - Rachel: Okay I didn't mention stockings, you've filled in some blanks there 🤔
14/04/2022, 23:32 - Adam: Regency isn't it, ain't no conservative lady showing leg or ankle under those dresses
14/04/2022, 23:35 - Rachel: Oh definitely not, that would be way too scandalous. But all those dresses show quite a lot of cleavage so apparently that's okay 😂
14/04/2022, 23:37 - Adam: Bad news for us leg men.
14/04/2022, 23:37 - Rachel: You're a leg man?
14/04/2022, 23:39 - Adam: Mhmm, you didn't notice my hand on your thigh? 😜🤣
14/04/2022, 23:40 - Rachel: Haha I did notice that but didn't really think anything of it 🤣
14/04/2022, 23:41 - Adam: Your show still on?
14/04/2022, 23:42 - Rachel: No I switched it off after that last episode, I'm in bed now
14/04/2022, 23:48 - Adam: 😉
14/04/2022, 23:48 - Rachel: 😜
14/04/2022, 23:48 - Adam: Adorable
14/04/2022, 23:51 - Rachel: Hahaha thanks 😂
14/04/2022, 23:56 - Adam: Deep breaths, Rach 😜🤣
14/04/2022, 23:58 - Rachel: Hahaha I'm fine 🤣 I am going to sleep now though so night 😜
14/04/2022, 23:58 - Adam: Goodnight love
15/04/2022, 12:02 - Rachel: Hey how are you?
15/04/2022, 14:55 - Adam: I'm good sweetheart, how are you? 😉😜
15/04/2022, 14:55 - Rachel: Yeah I'm good thanks 😊 What are you up to?
15/04/2022, 14:58 - Adam: Bit of tidying, gonna drag my dad out to the shop with me in a minute
15/04/2022, 14:58 - Adam: All very exciting
15/04/2022, 14:58 - Adam: Yourself?
15/04/2022, 15:03 - Rachel: Aww that's nice. Yeah not much either - I was doing some baking earlier for my family coming over tomorrow and now I'm just at a park near my flat
15/04/2022, 15:25 - Adam: Ooof, what you baking
15/04/2022, 15:27 - Rachel: I made some biscoff cheesecake bars! They look great, even if I do say so myself 😂
15/04/2022, 15:31 - Adam: Sounds almost as delicious as you are. 

I fucking love cheesecake 🤣😫
15/04/2022, 15:36 - Rachel: Oh well thank you 😊 Yeah I love baking, it's such a cliché but I started during the first lockdown. I haven't learnt how to make my bakes look nice and neat but they always taste good 😂
15/04/2022, 15:43 - Adam: I wanna try one 🤣
15/04/2022, 15:45 - Rachel: Haha I'll have to make something for you sometime 😜
15/04/2022, 16:29 - Adam: Lemme see, take a pic 😝
15/04/2022, 16:33 - Rachel: Of the cheesecakes? Just bear in mind that they're not very neat, like I said 😂
15/04/2022, 16:33 - Adam: Yes, the cheesecakes... Poser 😉
15/04/2022, 16:34 - Rachel: Hahahah I didn't mean that the way it sounded 🤣
15/04/2022, 16:35 - Adam: Lmao 🤣
15/04/2022, 16:36 - Rachel: <Media omitted>
15/04/2022, 18:05 - Adam: Calories 😍
15/04/2022, 18:05 - Rachel: Oh so many calories 😂
15/04/2022, 18:34 - Adam: Looks so deadly 😍🤣
15/04/2022, 18:47 - Rachel: Hahaha yeah definitely 😂 I'm gonna have to get everyone to take some home with them tomorrow 😜
15/04/2022, 18:49 - Adam: D day's approaching Rach 😉
15/04/2022, 18:52 - Rachel: Hahah yep, I'm currently trying to get ready 😂 I was so cocky about it on the phone last night but the outfit I thought I was gonna wear didn't look right when I tried it on so I'm back to square one 😜
15/04/2022, 19:06 - Adam: Lol don't feel rushed by the way
15/04/2022, 19:06 - Adam: I'm just here now with my friend Carl, they'll bugger off before you arrive 😜
15/04/2022, 19:08 - Rachel: Oh are you already there? Yeah no worries, I'm almost ready and then I'll just get an uber
15/04/2022, 19:27 - Rachel: I'm on my way now
15/04/2022, 19:35 - Adam: Okie doke!
16/04/2022, 03:46 - Rachel: I've just got home. Thanks for a great night 😊 x
16/04/2022, 03:46 - Adam: No worries 😉🤣🤣
16/04/2022, 03:47 - Adam: I'm having greasy take away right now 🤣
16/04/2022, 03:47 - Rachel: Hahaha that's the best thing after a night out 😂
16/04/2022, 03:49 - Adam: Mhmm
16/04/2022, 03:50 - Rachel: Hope you're not too mad that I didn't let you come home with me 😜
16/04/2022, 03:53 - Adam: Naaaaah, just hungry
16/04/2022, 03:53 - Adam: I'll find a way back home
16/04/2022, 03:54 - Rachel: Haha good, enjoy your takeaway. Oh I thought you'd already booked a taxi. Maybe try uber, they're much quicker
16/04/2022, 03:55 - Adam: I coulda just eaten you, ahh well
16/04/2022, 03:56 - Rachel: Hahaha another time 😜
16/04/2022, 04:01 - Adam: Lmao 🤣🤣🤣😉
16/04/2022, 04:01 - Adam: Ohhhh rachel
16/04/2022, 04:01 - Adam: God bless ya
16/04/2022, 04:02 - Rachel: Hahaha trust me, I wanted to say yes 😂 I just couldn't, I need a couple of dates first if that's okay 😜
16/04/2022, 04:04 - Adam: My rides keep getting cancelled! Rach!
16/04/2022, 04:22 - Rachel: Oh no you're joking! Have you got one yet?
16/04/2022, 04:22 - Adam: Just got. Home!
16/04/2022, 04:22 - Rachel: Oh that's good! Glad you weren't waiting too long
16/04/2022, 04:23 - Adam: Just 20 minutes!
16/04/2022, 04:24 - Rachel: These love bites that you've given me are ridiculous, I've had to smother my whole neck in toothpaste so hopefully they won't be as bad tomorrow 🤣
16/04/2022, 04:24 - Adam: You're welcome sexy
16/04/2022, 04:24 - Rachel: Aww I feel bad for not letting you get in my uber now!
16/04/2022, 10:33 - Adam: Bless ys
16/04/2022, 10:33 - Adam: Ya even
16/04/2022, 10:55 - Rachel: Haha morning, you okay?
16/04/2022, 10:57 - Adam: Mhmm, good morning!

How's the neck? 😉
16/04/2022, 11:04 - Rachel: Very sore and the toothpaste didn't work at all 😂 You can't give me any next week, my neck needs a break 😜
16/04/2022, 12:17 - Adam: I'll need something else to nibble and suck on. 😑
16/04/2022, 12:19 - Rachel: Well I said that I wanted to do something other than drinking next time so we can go for food, and you can nibble on that instead 😜
16/04/2022, 15:11 - Adam: I eat ridiculously fast, deffo no nibbling there 🤣🤣🤦
16/04/2022, 15:24 - Adam: Please, please tell me your family has noticed your neck 😍🤣🤣
16/04/2022, 15:27 - Rachel: Oh well you might have to try and slow that down or you'll just be waiting for me for ages 😂 They're not actually here yet but I think I'm gonna get away with it 😂 Lots of concealer and my hair covering it, I should be okay! I meant what I said though, no more hickies. You can still kiss my neck but it's just too stressful for me to try and cover them 😂
16/04/2022, 15:38 - Adam: Ohhhh I can still kiss your neck can I! How generous of you Rachel! 🤣😜
16/04/2022, 15:38 - Rachel: I aim to please 😜
16/04/2022, 15:39 - Adam: Ohh really, I'll hold you to that. 😉
16/04/2022, 15:45 - Rachel: Hahaha that's fine 😜
16/04/2022, 15:55 - Adam: You're a saucy little thing. 😉🔥
16/04/2022, 15:57 - Rachel: Haha do you reckon? 😂
16/04/2022, 16:07 - Adam: I do
16/04/2022, 16:07 - Rachel: Well thanks, I'll take that as a compliment 😜
16/04/2022, 16:14 - Adam: <Media omitted>
16/04/2022, 16:15 - Rachel: <Media omitted>
16/04/2022, 16:17 - Adam: Goggles are on 😉🔥
16/04/2022, 16:19 - Rachel: Hahaha yep, need the goggles today 😂
16/04/2022, 16:20 - Adam: <Media omitted>
16/04/2022, 16:21 - Rachel: Hahaha cute 😝 What are   you up to today?
16/04/2022, 16:23 - Adam: Enjoying what little sun we're having with my cats and listening to music. 🤣
16/04/2022, 16:23 - Adam: Might take my dad round to see my sister later if he's up to it
16/04/2022, 16:24 - Rachel: That sounds like a great day! 🤣 Aww that's really nice, hope he's doing okay
16/04/2022, 16:38 - Adam: What are you up to?
16/04/2022, 16:48 - Rachel: My family have just arrived now so we'll be ordering some tea in a bit 😊
16/04/2022, 16:59 - Adam: What you fancying?
16/04/2022, 16:59 - Adam: Except me that is
16/04/2022, 17:28 - Rachel: Hahaha of course 😜 We've just ordered from Chester's, that's usually okay
16/04/2022, 17:44 - Adam: Never tried them
16/04/2022, 18:50 - Rachel: Oh have you not? It's nothing too exciting, it's just a standard greasy takeaway 😜
16/04/2022, 19:13 - Adam: If it's nice tomorrow I'll prolly be chilling in moss bank park listening to music, you're welcome to join me if you want
16/04/2022, 19:34 - Rachel: Oh yeah that sounds nice 😊 I'm going to my sister's sometime after half 3 but I'll be free anytime before that
16/04/2022, 19:54 - Adam: Cool 😉
16/04/2022, 19:54 - Rachel: Yeah just let me know what time 😊
16/04/2022, 20:22 - Adam: Prolly be around 12ish, hopefully the sun's out. I'll let you know when I'm there.

Might get to be a lucky girl and see my legs in shorts. 😉🤣
16/04/2022, 20:23 - Rachel: Okay no worries. Haha what a treat 😂
17/04/2022, 12:02 - Adam: Running a bit later than expected 🤣, I'll be up there in about 15/20 mins
17/04/2022, 12:04 - Rachel: Oh that's okay! I'll aim to get there for about 20 past then
17/04/2022, 12:20 - Adam: 😎
17/04/2022, 12:22 - Adam: Could be a tight squeeze for parking if you're in the car 🤣
17/04/2022, 15:32 - Adam: Breathe 😉
17/04/2022, 15:47 - Rachel: Well you were bound to see me fall over at some point so at least we've got it out of the way 🤣
17/04/2022, 15:49 - Adam: Falling for me are ya? 😉🤣🤣
17/04/2022, 15:49 - Adam: How's the knee
17/04/2022, 15:56 - Rachel: Hahaha I think that must be it 🤣🤣 Oh there was quite a lot of blood, I had to clean it when I got to my mum's 😂 I was trying to pretend to you that it wasn't hurting as much as it was 🤣🤣
17/04/2022, 16:01 - Adam: Fucking hell Rachel! 🤣

Tripping up is always a killer. I did it the other week, that why there's cuts on the palm of my left hand, full weight behind me 🤣
17/04/2022, 16:17 - Rachel: Oh really? How did you fall? At least it's not just me then, that makes me feel slightly better 🤣🤣 It's always so embarrassing 🙈 

It's added nicely to my lump from falling in the shower though 😂
17/04/2022, 16:26 - Adam: I apparently forgot how to walk 🤦I'm always doing it lol.

Anyway, I should have caught ya, my fault 😉🤣
17/04/2022, 17:46 - Rachel: Haha me too! It's easily done 🤣 Hahaha yeah you should 😉 You'll have to be more prepared next time 😜
17/04/2022, 17:59 - Adam: God damn, I can still smell you all over me. 🔥
17/04/2022, 18:12 - Rachel: Hmm really? I'll have to make sure I wear that perfume every time we meet up 😜
17/04/2022, 19:48 - Adam: Shit's delicious 🤣
17/04/2022, 20:02 - Rachel: Hahaha thank you very much 🤣 You always smell good too 😜
17/04/2022, 20:21 - Adam: Thank you, I'm a bit obsessed with fragrances 🤣
17/04/2022, 20:24 - Rachel: Hahaha that's not a bad thing, I always think you smell nice 😜
17/04/2022, 20:44 - Adam: I had Armani code on today
17/04/2022, 20:45 - Rachel: Oh nice! Maybe I should get some different fragrances too, I only really have the Jimmy choo perfume 😜
17/04/2022, 20:57 - Adam: Hell of a choice though 😉
17/04/2022, 20:58 - Rachel: Oh well thank you 😉
17/04/2022, 20:58 - Rachel: Oh I meant to say earlier - I think I feel more comfortable now if you ever want to talk on the phone again. I know you said you're not a massive fan of texting
17/04/2022, 21:36 - Adam: Missing my voice are ya
17/04/2022, 21:36 - Rachel: Is it that obvious? 😜
17/04/2022, 21:44 - Adam: My accent sucks 🤣
17/04/2022, 21:45 - Rachel: Hahaha no it doesn't, it's just a Bolton accent 🤣 I'm from Bolton too, I can't say your accent sucks 😜
17/04/2022, 22:00 - Adam: You do have a sexy voice though
17/04/2022, 22:01 - Rachel: Oh well thank you. So do you
17/04/2022, 22:03 - Adam: You in bed? Or watching TV?
17/04/2022, 22:04 - Rachel: I'm just watching a film. You?
17/04/2022, 22:05 - Adam: Reading news, what you watching?
17/04/2022, 22:06 - Rachel: Oh what are you reading about? It's called 24 hour party people, have you ever watched it?
17/04/2022, 22:09 - Adam: This shit that's happening in Ukraine.

I've not no, any good?
17/04/2022, 22:09 - Adam: I must proper disappoint you, I never know your films 🤣🤣🤦
17/04/2022, 22:12 - Rachel: Oh yeah that makes sense, that's pretty much the main news right now.

Hahaha this is the first time I've watched it and it's not that great so far, so I'll let you off this time 😂 It's got Steve Coogan in it, it's like a mockumentary about the Manchester music scene in the 70s. It's got good music in it but it's kinda boring so far, I'll stick with it though 😂

I do need to give you a film education though, you've never watched any of the films I talk about 😜
17/04/2022, 22:18 - Adam: I like my russian history, it's sad what's happening really.

Steve Coogan is hit or miss tbh, he can be a bit dry sometimes. When was it made? Sounds like film4 fodder 🤣🤣

A stern, film education, is this your way of flirting with me Rachel 😉🤣
17/04/2022, 22:21 - Rachel: Oh yeah it's heartbreaking when you see the clips of it on the news.

It was made in 2002 but it seems so much older. Yeah it's very dull 😂

Hahaha I'll make the education exciting, I promise 🤣
17/04/2022, 22:26 - Adam: How long is left of it? 🤣

Ohhhhh really now? How you gonna do that, then? 😉🤣
17/04/2022, 22:30 - Rachel: Like an hour and a half 🤣 I'm terrible for not wanting to turn films off once I've started them though, even if I'm not enjoying it. 

Hahaha you'll see when you come over for our movie night 😂 I think we'll have to start with Harry Potter 😜
17/04/2022, 22:33 - Adam: There's only one film I can recall turning off in absolute disgust. And that was independence day 2. 

When would you like this movie night, Rachel? 😉
17/04/2022, 22:36 - Rachel: Oh really? I don't think I've seen that, is it not as good as the first one? I haven't seen the first one to be fair 😜

Hmm how about we go out for food as planned on Friday, and then the next date after that can be a movie night?
17/04/2022, 22:43 - Adam: Felt like my brain was leaking through my ears. And nah, the first one was okay at best 🤣

Sounds good 😜
17/04/2022, 22:46 - Rachel: Hahaha yeah I won't bother with that then 😂

Haha good, it's a date 😜
17/04/2022, 23:22 - Adam: I'll look forward to it 😉
17/04/2022, 23:23 - Rachel: Hahaha me too 😉
17/04/2022, 23:44 - Rachel: So the film's finally finished and it didn't get better 😂
17/04/2022, 23:44 - Adam: Awwww
17/04/2022, 23:44 - Adam: Gotta love wasting your time 🤣
17/04/2022, 23:45 - Rachel: Haha yeah definitely a waste of 2 hours 😂 What are you up to? I think I'm gonna get in bed now
17/04/2022, 23:46 - Adam: About to get in bed myself in a minute
17/04/2022, 23:49 - Rachel: Ah fair enough!
17/04/2022, 23:51 - Adam: <Media omitted>
17/04/2022, 23:52 - Rachel: <Media omitted>
17/04/2022, 23:52 - Adam: Oooo pink
17/04/2022, 23:53 - Adam: As is your chest and arm 🤣🤣😉
17/04/2022, 23:53 - Rachel: Hahaha yeah I was just thinking that, it blends in nicely 🤣
17/04/2022, 23:53 - Adam: What's been on your mind? 😉
17/04/2022, 23:54 - Rachel: Hmm since earlier today? 😜
17/04/2022, 23:55 - Adam: How's the ears and neck feeling? 😜
17/04/2022, 23:56 - Rachel: Hahaha they're feeling pretty good, thanks for asking 😜 And at least the bruises are fading 🤣
18/04/2022, 00:16 - Rachel: <Media omitted>
18/04/2022, 01:35 - Adam: Awww, poor leggies
18/04/2022, 01:35 - Rachel: Hahaha yeah it's not a great look 🤣
18/04/2022, 01:36 - Adam: Still kissable
18/04/2022, 01:44 - Rachel: Hahaha thank you, I'll take that 😜
18/04/2022, 01:45 - Adam: Good girl
18/04/2022, 01:46 - Rachel: Hahaha 😂

Goodnight 😊
18/04/2022, 01:46 - Adam: Goodnight giggler
18/04/2022, 01:47 - Rachel: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
18/04/2022, 01:47 - Adam: 😉🤣🤣
19/04/2022, 07:31 - Rachel: Hey I hope your thing goes okay today!
19/04/2022, 12:35 - Adam: Having to do it tomorrow instead. (Dad) sister should be around in a bit, I'll have a word with her to come round here more often in the week.

Thank you though, you're an absolute sweetheart. 😘
19/04/2022, 12:41 - Rachel: Aww okay. Yeah I really hope you manage to get some help and he starts to get a bit better. 

Of course, anytime 😘
19/04/2022, 13:03 - Adam: How are those sexy legs of yours? 😉😘
19/04/2022, 13:05 - Rachel: Hahaha still very bruised and sore 🤣 I tried to kneel down to do something before and I literally couldn't 😂
19/04/2022, 13:08 - Adam: Turns out knees are really important for moving about, eh? 🤣🤣🤣

When I lacerated mine in 2019 I was practically bedridden
19/04/2022, 13:10 - Rachel: Literally 🤣🤣

Oh god, what did you do to them?
19/04/2022, 13:19 - Adam: Basically what you did on Sunday... Forgot how to walk. 🤣

I was hiking and landed on the smallest of stones, completely split my knee 🤣
19/04/2022, 13:20 - Rachel: Oh god that sounds awful 🙈🙈 Were you on your own?
19/04/2022, 13:22 - Adam: I was, had to walk about half mile to find somewhere to get an ambulance to pick me up. 🤣
19/04/2022, 13:22 - Rachel: Oh shit! Wow that sounds very dramatic 🤣
19/04/2022, 14:11 - Adam: Dunno if you like gore, think pics of it are on my other phone 🤣
19/04/2022, 14:12 - Rachel: Yeah I'm intrigued now 😂 I'm not great with gore so I'll look at it for a  sec and then delete it 😜
19/04/2022, 14:49 - Adam: Just charging old phone now 🤣
19/04/2022, 15:12 - Rachel: Hahaha I look forward to seeing it 🤣🤣
19/04/2022, 18:03 - Adam: <Media omitted>
19/04/2022, 18:03 - Adam: <Media omitted>
19/04/2022, 18:03 - Adam: <Media omitted>
19/04/2022, 18:04 - Rachel: Oh god 😲 That's even worse than I imagined, that looks awful 🙈
19/04/2022, 18:06 - Adam: Hence me being worried about you on Sunday 🤣
19/04/2022, 18:08 - Rachel: Aww bless you, that's very sweet 😂 Yeah my knees were nowhere near as bad as that, it could have been a lot worse 🤣 Did you have to have stitches?
19/04/2022, 18:10 - Adam: That last pic is the stitch, best they could do. I was missing skin. 🤣🤦
19/04/2022, 18:12 - Rachel: Oh god, that is horrendous 🙈 You weren't wrong, it is very gory! I guess you're as accident prone as me then 😂
19/04/2022, 18:13 - Adam: Belter that isn't it. And yeah, I'm pretty bad.
19/04/2022, 18:16 - Rachel: Yeah it looks so painful! 😕 Haha it's easily done, you just forget how to walk sometimes 😂
19/04/2022, 18:23 - Adam: On the day it was fine, just a little sensitive... Morning after however. 😫

And yeah Literally. Fell over my own feet and burst apart my knee 🤦
19/04/2022, 18:26 - Rachel: Oh wow really? Yeah that's insane how much damage you've done just from falling over your feet 🙈
19/04/2022, 19:23 - Adam: It's dangerous work being a moron like me, Rach
19/04/2022, 19:25 - Rachel: I think moron's a bit harsh 🤣
19/04/2022, 20:43 - Adam: Awww, aren't ya nice to me 🤣
19/04/2022, 20:50 - Rachel: Hahaha I do try 🤣 I do think that me falling over on our 2nd date would make me much more of a moron than you 😂
19/04/2022, 20:51 - Adam: Nooooo, you don't still feel embarrassed by that do ya? 🤣
19/04/2022, 20:54 - Rachel: Hahaha no I managed to stop feeling embarrassed eventually 🤣
19/04/2022, 20:59 - Adam: You're cute
19/04/2022, 21:00 - Rachel: Hahaha thanks. You're cute too 😜
20/04/2022, 16:37 - Rachel: Hey how did it go today? 😊
20/04/2022, 17:15 - Adam: Heya gorgeous 😉
20/04/2022, 17:15 - Adam: Yeah it was good catching up with Paul again. I've given my details to one of the ladies who works there. She'll see if there's anything around the Bolton area for me.
20/04/2022, 17:16 - Rachel: Hey 😉

Oh that's great then! Hopefully you won't be waiting too long 😊
20/04/2022, 17:18 - Adam: Yeah, they're in contact with building firms. Hopefully there'll be something. Gonna send out some more feelers while I wait
20/04/2022, 17:20 - Adam: <Media omitted>
20/04/2022, 17:29 - Rachel: Oh that's really good! 😊

Looks so nice 😍
20/04/2022, 17:34 - Adam: Shame you've not managed to get those sexy legs of yours out in it 😍🤣
20/04/2022, 17:38 - Rachel: Hahaha yes it is, I wish 🤣 Hopefully it will be nice again at the weekend and I can get them out then 😜
20/04/2022, 17:44 - Adam: Oooof, god damn. Brb, praying to any and all solar deities 😉😝
20/04/2022, 17:48 - Adam: How your legs looking btw

20/04/2022, 22:12 - Adam: Sorry I forgot to reply! I've no worries meeting you there love 

Ahahaha, anxiety kicking in already? 😉
20/04/2022, 22:19 - Rachel: Oh that's okay! Yeah I'll just meet you there then 😊

Hahaha I just know that if I have an issue with parking, I will be stressed before the date has started 😂 Like, you don't want to know how red my chest and arms will be 😂
20/04/2022, 22:21 - Adam: I assure you, I really do 😉🤣
20/04/2022, 22:22 - Rachel: Haha yeah I'm sure you'd probably enjoy it 🤣
20/04/2022, 22:28 - Adam: It's actually quite sexy you know
20/04/2022, 22:28 - Rachel: Do you think? Well I'm glad you think so 😜
20/04/2022, 22:31 - Adam: Ohh, I certainly do

23/04/2022, 14:50 - Rachel: Is that right? 😜 x
23/04/2022, 14:57 - Adam: Ohh, I absolutely do.
23/04/2022, 15:25 - Rachel: <Media omitted>
23/04/2022, 15:33 - Adam: They look fit
23/04/2022, 15:35 - Rachel: Thanks! They taste pretty good actually, even if I do say so myself 😜 You can't really tell that they're gluten free x
23/04/2022, 15:37 - Adam: Gimme a taste
23/04/2022, 15:38 - Rachel: Well you'll just have to wait until next Saturday
23/04/2022, 16:22 - Adam: Oooof, they look so delicious however.
23/04/2022, 16:24 - Rachel: Thank you! So I followed you on Instagram this morning and I have to say, I'm very upset that you haven't followed me back 💔
23/04/2022, 16:24 - Adam: I didn't even notice!
23/04/2022, 16:25 - Rachel: Wow that was very quick, I appreciate that 😜
23/04/2022, 16:25 - Adam: So many notifications on that app 🤣
23/04/2022, 16:25 - Rachel: Hahaha I'll let you off then, you're clearly just so popular 🤣
23/04/2022, 16:25 - Adam: Apparently a message from Kyle on my course too 🤣🤦
23/04/2022, 16:26 - Rachel: Oh god, how long ago did he message you? 🤣
23/04/2022, 16:26 - Adam: Naaah, not on there, just a bit of a spammy app I think. I need to go into settings
23/04/2022, 16:26 - Adam: Just this morning
23/04/2022, 16:27 - Rachel: Ah yeah that's fair enough. Oh good, at least you've not been ignoring him too long then haha
23/04/2022, 16:28 - Adam: When are your friends arriving?
23/04/2022, 16:29 - Rachel: They should be getting here for about 5 ish. So I might not reply too quickly after that
23/04/2022, 16:48 - Rachel: I've just discovered the biggest spider in my bathroom so my friend will be sorting that the second she arrives 🤣
23/04/2022, 17:07 - Adam: No worries, am I gonna be treated to drunken shenanigans tonight? 😉
23/04/2022, 17:07 - Adam: Spiders are friends!
23/04/2022, 17:08 - Rachel: Hahaha if you're lucky 😜

Oh this spider is not my friend. It's good to know that you're not scared of spiders though, that's very useful to me 😂
23/04/2022, 17:12 - Adam: I better be 😉🤣

I bet it's tiny!
23/04/2022, 17:13 - Rachel: Hahaha 😉

It's got really long legs!! I can send you a picture if you don't believe me? 😜 xxx
23/04/2022, 17:15 - Rachel: <Media omitted>
23/04/2022, 17:18 - Adam: House spider, it'll eat worse gribblies 🤣
23/04/2022, 18:28 - Rachel: Well the spider is no more now 😂
23/04/2022, 18:43 - Adam: RIP Boris 😞
23/04/2022, 18:54 - Rachel: A very appropriate name 😂 I'm sure he had a good life 💔
23/04/2022, 19:12 - Adam: Took long enough to kill him 🤣
23/04/2022, 19:22 - Rachel: Oh trust me I made her kill him the second she arrived, I was just delayed in messaging you 🤣 She hadn't even taken her jacket off yet 😜
23/04/2022, 19:37 - Adam: 🤣🤣 how many have you got 'round?
23/04/2022, 20:41 - Rachel: There's 4 of us. We've just finished our takeaway and we're just starting to play our first game now 😊 Oh and we got 2 free cobra beers with our takeaway so you can have them next week 😜
23/04/2022, 20:57 - Adam: Oooof, what did you order?

And thank you very much, I shall 😉
23/04/2022, 21:24 - Rachel: We just got an Indian, it was pretty good!

Ah no worries, I thought you said that's what you drink 😜
23/04/2022, 21:30 - Adam: <Media omitted>
23/04/2022, 22:50 - Rachel: Heyyyy you look cute. I'd send a selfie back but preoccupied haha
23/04/2022, 23:03 - Adam: I demand a drunken selfie 🤣🔥
23/04/2022, 23:09 - Rachel: <Media omitted>
23/04/2022, 23:16 - Adam: Sexy little thing aren't ya
23/04/2022, 23:17 - Rachel: Hahaha thank you. Like a radiator right now haha
23/04/2022, 23:24 - Adam: Good girl, enjoying your night then 😜
23/04/2022, 23:29 - Rachel: Haha yeah it's been so great thanks 😜 You enjoying your night?
23/04/2022, 23:36 - Adam: Good 😘

It's just been a quiet one for me, got asked out but couldn't be arsed. 🤣
23/04/2022, 23:43 - Rachel: Refusing a night out, that doesn't sound like you 😜
23/04/2022, 23:44 - Rachel: <Media omitted>
23/04/2022, 23:58 - Adam: Bad innit 🤣 

It meant going farnworth. Sod that. If they were out in Bolton I would have likely joined them. 🤣

You don't look nearly drunk enough. 🔥😜
23/04/2022, 23:59 - Rachel: Wow they were going out in Farnworth, what's that like? 😂 Oh sorry, I must try harder 😜
24/04/2022, 00:00 - Adam: Well, the one pub I've been to... Not great 🤣

I insist you do. 😉😜
24/04/2022, 00:09 - Rachel: Yeah I imagine that's even worse than Bolton 🤣

I was pretty drunk before but I've sobered up a bit now 😜
24/04/2022, 00:16 - Adam: Your drunk and my drunk are very, very, very different 🤣😜
24/04/2022, 00:23 - Rachel: Hahaha that's very true 🤣 It doesn't take much, I'm a cheap date 😜
24/04/2022, 00:56 - Adam: There's nothing cheap about you, love 😉
24/04/2022, 00:57 - Rachel: Ooh thank you, what a compliment 😉
24/04/2022, 01:24 - Adam: <Media omitted>
24/04/2022, 01:49 - Rachel: <Media omitted>
24/04/2022, 01:50 - Adam: Cute 😉
24/04/2022, 01:51 - Rachel: Thanks, you too 😉
24/04/2022, 01:56 - Adam: Your smile 🔥
24/04/2022, 08:27 - Rachel: Oh thank you very much 😘

Sorry, I had already gone to sleep then 😜
24/04/2022, 09:09 - Adam: I guessed, just thought I'd get a cheeky one in before you were
24/04/2022, 09:40 - Rachel: Well thank you, I appreciated waking up to it 😜
24/04/2022, 11:22 - Adam: What else do you like waking up to, Rachel? 😉
24/04/2022, 11:29 - Rachel: Hmm having my breakfast made for me? 😜 

That the answer you were looking for? 😜
24/04/2022, 11:53 - Adam: 🤣🤣 it'll do
24/04/2022, 11:54 - Rachel: Hahaha yeah, I know exactly what you're thinking 😜
24/04/2022, 12:00 - Adam: Hahaha, and what exactly was I thinking? 😉
24/04/2022, 12:07 - Rachel: We both know what you're thinking 😜
24/04/2022, 12:15 - Adam: A foot rub and a cuddle, what on earth is racing through your mind Rachel? 😉🤣
24/04/2022, 12:16 - Rachel: Oh I could definitely go for a foot rub and a cuddle right now 😉
24/04/2022, 12:27 - Adam: Good girl
24/04/2022, 12:29 - Rachel: How's your day going, are you up to much?
24/04/2022, 12:48 - Adam: Sunlight, music, pussy cats. Seeing my sister later. Chill day really
24/04/2022, 12:48 - Adam: Why, you got foot massages on your mind now?
24/04/2022, 13:21 - Rachel: Oh sounds good! Hahaha no, I was just wondering 🤣 I can wait until next week 😜
24/04/2022, 13:30 - Adam: Ohhhh can you now!? Saucy. Get that wine varnish on your toes for me then. 😉
24/04/2022, 13:35 - Rachel: Hahaha so demanding 😜
24/04/2022, 13:50 - Adam: Voracious
24/04/2022, 13:53 - Rachel: Well I'm happy to accommodate
24/04/2022, 14:16 - Adam: <Media omitted>
24/04/2022, 14:19 - Rachel: <Media omitted>
24/04/2022, 14:21 - Adam: You pale girls, my kryptonite,🔥🤣
24/04/2022, 14:22 - Adam: Beaut
24/04/2022, 14:27 - Rachel: Hahaha thank you, I'm glad you like how pale I am 🤣🤣
24/04/2022, 14:28 - Adam: I adore how pale you are 😉
24/04/2022, 14:30 - Rachel: Oh well thank you, I would prefer if I wasn't so pale but at least you like it 🤣
24/04/2022, 14:46 - Adam: <Media omitted>
24/04/2022, 14:47 - Rachel: Aww that's so cute! 😊
24/04/2022, 14:48 - Adam: <Media omitted>
24/04/2022, 15:26 - Rachel: Aww she's got such a cute grumpy face 🤣
24/04/2022, 17:13 - Adam: Always has that face 🤣
24/04/2022, 17:19 - Adam: <Media omitted>
24/04/2022, 17:39 - Rachel: Aww she's got a pretty grumpy face too 🤣 They're both so cute!
24/04/2022, 17:55 - Adam: <Media omitted>
24/04/2022, 17:55 - Adam: <Media omitted>
24/04/2022, 17:56 - Adam: Just pussy cats everywhere!
24/04/2022, 17:56 - Rachel: Hahaha you're living the dream right now 🤣
24/04/2022, 17:58 - Adam: I do appreciate a cute pussy
24/04/2022, 18:11 - Rachel: Is that right? 😜
24/04/2022, 18:17 - Adam: Like you wouldn't believe
24/04/2022, 18:32 - Rachel: Good to know 😜
24/04/2022, 19:12 - Adam: What you up to, trouble?
24/04/2022, 19:14 - Rachel: Not much, I'm just watching Rocketman. You?
24/04/2022, 19:16 - Adam: *Google's* musical drama... I don't know what I expected 🤣🤣🤣
24/04/2022, 19:16 - Adam: I'm still at my sister's, playing a wrestling game with my nephew. 🤣
24/04/2022, 19:17 - Rachel: Hahaha I'm surprised you haven't heard of this musical! 🤣🤣

Oh nice! How old is your nephew?
24/04/2022, 19:19 - Adam: <Media omitted>
24/04/2022, 19:19 - Adam: Never heard of it 🤣🤣
24/04/2022, 19:19 - Adam: He's 16
24/04/2022, 19:20 - Rachel: It's about Elton John, it's pretty good so far! I have so much to teach you about films 😜 

Aww cute!
24/04/2022, 19:24 - Adam: I'm usually the star pupil
24/04/2022, 19:25 - Rachel: Well I hope so 😜
24/04/2022, 20:30 - Adam: Wouldn't have guessed I worked in a cinema would ya 🤣
24/04/2022, 20:32 - Rachel: No not at all! 🤣 Were you just so sick of being there that you never wanted to go when you weren't working? 😜
24/04/2022, 20:35 - Adam: That's precisely it
24/04/2022, 20:48 - Rachel: Yeah that makes sense. You should definitely start watching more films now that you don't work there though! You're missing out on so much 😜
24/04/2022, 20:55 - Adam: Cinema is dead, babes 😉🤣
24/04/2022, 20:56 - Rachel: I will singlehandedly keep it going, don't you worry about that 🤣 Watching films at home is great, with the ease of streaming services, but there's certain films you just have to see on the big screen first!
24/04/2022, 21:32 - Adam: Ahem... Like musicals. 🤣🤣
24/04/2022, 21:34 - Rachel: Hahaha of course 🤣🤣 They're better live in the theatre anyway 😜
24/04/2022, 21:41 - Adam: Theatre snob. 😉🤣
24/04/2022, 21:42 - Rachel: Hahaha how dare you 😜
25/04/2022, 18:33 - Rachel: Hey how are you? 😊
25/04/2022, 19:00 - Adam: Heya gorgeous, I'm good. Might go to chippy for my tea 🤣 

How are you?
25/04/2022, 19:03 - Rachel: Ooh nice, what are you gonna get?

Yeah I'm not bad thanks! Just going to the cinema to watch the new fantastic beasts film, got to keep the industry going 🤣
25/04/2022, 19:15 - Adam: Half chips, rice and curry I'm feeling 🤣

Ahhhh, who are you dragging with you to prop up this dying industry? 😉
25/04/2022, 22:00 - Rachel: Ooh good choice! 

Hahaha I went with my friend Catherine and we were literally the only ones in the screen 🤣
25/04/2022, 22:12 - Adam: That's the worst thing that can happen, if it's an empty screen you can atleast turn it off to save leccy and hours on the lamp. 🤣
25/04/2022, 22:14 - Rachel: But what about my need to watch fantastic beasts??? 🤣

It was great actually, we could discuss the film whilst it was on without having to whisper or worry about other people 🤣
25/04/2022, 22:16 - Adam: You have many needs do ya? 

Ohh yeah, definitely great for the customer, absolutely disastrous for the cinema. 🤣
25/04/2022, 22:20 - Rachel: I have so many needs 😜

Hahaha yeah I imagine it's a nightmare with how much it costs to run but we had a great time 🤣
25/04/2022, 22:27 - Adam: Ohh do you now? Perhaps I could help relieve you of your tremendous, aching burdens.  

I'm glad you had a good time, they showing anything else decent?
25/04/2022, 22:29 - Rachel: I would greatly appreciate that, thank you.

Erm not that I saw - the new Doctor Strange film comes out next week so we'll go watch that maybe the week after. You probably wouldn't be a fan, Thanos isn't in it 😜
25/04/2022, 22:42 - Adam: I remember doc strange looking pretty decent on our 3d screen, but no I didn't watch it fully 🤣🤣
25/04/2022, 22:43 - Rachel: See, this is one of the films that you still need the cinema for! 🤣
25/04/2022, 22:51 - Adam: Sure! But it's a total wasteland! 🤣
25/04/2022, 22:54 - Rachel: Hopefully it won't be when this film comes out!  What I think is part of the problem is that films are being released onto Disney plus at the same time as in the cinema, so people can just watch them at home. Who do you think I can speak to to get them to stop doing that? 😜
25/04/2022, 22:59 - Adam: Here's a thought Rachel, love. Cancel your Disney+ plus to send a message 😜🤣

They get 💯 of your sub rather than 60 percent of a ticket price. 

Looking at films, only thing I'd have any interest in is The Northman. I can't see that type of film doing well anymore.
25/04/2022, 23:00 - Rachel: Ooh now I think that's going a bit too far 😜 

I don't think I know that film, what's that about?
25/04/2022, 23:06 - Adam: Vikings and revenge
25/04/2022, 23:07 - Rachel: Well we can go and watch it sometime if you want?
25/04/2022, 23:14 - Adam: Missing me? 😜
25/04/2022, 23:15 - Rachel: Hahaha of course 😜
25/04/2022, 23:22 - Adam: Ditto, babe 🔥
25/04/2022, 23:27 - Rachel: Haha good 🔥
25/04/2022, 23:31 - Adam: <Media omitted>
25/04/2022, 23:32 - Rachel: <Media omitted>
25/04/2022, 23:35 - Adam: Fancy a cuddle, love? 😉
25/04/2022, 23:36 - Rachel: Oh yes, I would love that 😉
25/04/2022, 23:41 - Adam: Any time 😉
25/04/2022, 23:44 - Rachel: It's a plan then 🤣
25/04/2022, 23:51 - Adam: Good girl 😘
25/04/2022, 23:52 - Rachel: I think I'm gonna have to get some sleep now, night 😘
25/04/2022, 23:53 - Adam: Sweet dreams
25/04/2022, 23:54 - Rachel: You too
26/04/2022, 18:47 - Rachel: Hey how's your day been?

28/04/2022, 17:58 - Adam: As expected really, wasn't willing to go out. The carer/nurse didn't do anything to get him out. I just said fuck it and come back another day.

His CPN doesn't work Fridays so I'll have to ring him up on Monday.
28/04/2022, 17:58 - Adam: Went in to town and now I'm at my sisters
28/04/2022, 18:01 - Rachel: Aww I'm really sorry, I hope it works out next time they come. I hope that you're not having to wait too long.

How's your sister?
28/04/2022, 18:04 - Adam: They're coming round Monday, if they're shit again I'll ring his CPN 🤣

Yeah she's good, offered me tater hash but i didn't fancy it.
28/04/2022, 18:07 - Rachel: Yeah it's not great that they didn't really do anything, surely that's part of the reason they're there. 

Glad she's good. Ooh nice, you should have accepted your tea being made for you!
28/04/2022, 18:46 - Adam: I'm not really a fan of tater hash 😔
28/04/2022, 18:46 - Adam: I'm always thankful tho 😉
28/04/2022, 18:47 - Rachel: Oh really? Is tater hash the same thing as corned beef hash? 😜

Oh I'm sure you were, you're always polite 😉
28/04/2022, 18:50 - Adam: Pretty much 🤣

I try 😉

So what mischief are you up to? Sexy
28/04/2022, 18:52 - Rachel: Hahaha I'm not up to too much mischief just yet, I'm just watching Inside number 9 and then I'm gonna finish that job application I started last night. What about you, are you still at your sister's?

28/04/2022, 22:22 - Adam: It's because it's something you're passionate about
28/04/2022, 22:23 - Rachel: Yeah that's true, that's why I'm trying to take my time with it and do it properly. I should hopefully get it finished tomorrow though!

29/04/2022, 17:28 - Adam: <Media omitted>
29/04/2022, 17:28 - Rachel: And they just don't even realise it 🤣
29/04/2022, 17:28 - Adam: Look at all that I've brushed out of her 🤣
29/04/2022, 17:28 - Rachel: Jeeeeeez that's insane 🤣
29/04/2022, 17:28 - Adam: So many knots 😍
29/04/2022, 17:29 - Adam: Satisfaction 🤣
29/04/2022, 17:29 - Rachel: I feel like you could make a new cat with that 🤣

29/04/2022, 21:49 - Adam: 🤣🤣🤣
29/04/2022, 21:50 - Adam: Yea, we're a bit strange 🤣
29/04/2022, 21:51 - Rachel: Hahaha yeah I can see that 🤣 It's the best way 😜
29/04/2022, 22:03 - Adam: Not that innocent then 😉
29/04/2022, 22:05 - Rachel: I'm actually very innocent,  reading it all was way too much for my little eyes 😜
29/04/2022, 22:20 - Adam: You in bed?
29/04/2022, 22:21 - Rachel: No not yet, just watching TV. You?
29/04/2022, 22:27 - Adam: Just on my computer, reading a bit of news
29/04/2022, 22:27 - Adam: Incredibly exciting
29/04/2022, 22:28 - Rachel: Oh what are you reading about?
29/04/2022, 22:48 - Adam: This Johnny Depp shit
29/04/2022, 22:49 - Rachel: Oh yeah it's awful isn't it?
29/04/2022, 23:06 - Adam: Pretty embarrassing to go through, don't see the point of it
29/04/2022, 23:09 - Rachel: Yeah I think the whole case now is to show he was a victim because after the last case, she made it seem like he was just abusive to her but it sounds like she was the main abuser. Sounds like a toxic marriage all round really
29/04/2022, 23:14 - Adam: Toxic all around, exactly what I was thinking 🤣
29/04/2022, 23:16 - Rachel: Yeah I mean, she shit in his bed. Like, who does that? 🤣 Because surely his bed was also her bed 🤣
29/04/2022, 23:20 - Adam: That's her reputation now... A bed shitter 🤦🤣
29/04/2022, 23:23 - Rachel: Yeah literally, no one will remember any films that she's been in 🤣
29/04/2022, 23:31 - Adam: What were you watching?
29/04/2022, 23:33 - Rachel: I was watching Gogglebox, have you ever watched that? I'm guessing you won't have - if you don't really watch TV, you're not gonna watch a show which is just other people watching TV 😜
29/04/2022, 23:46 - Adam: Yeah I know Gogglebox 🤣
29/04/2022, 23:47 - Rachel: At least you've heard of it, that's a start 🤣
29/04/2022, 23:50 - Adam: I may have watched a couple as well, saucy eh
29/04/2022, 23:58 - Rachel: Saucy? 😜

01/05/2022, 15:27 - Rachel: Hahaha yep, she knew instantly 🤣
01/05/2022, 15:29 - Adam: I think that smile you were carrying around gave it away first 😉
01/05/2022, 15:35 - Rachel: Hahaha that's true, I can't hide my feelings at all 😜
01/05/2022, 15:49 - Adam: You been grilled yet? 🤣
01/05/2022, 16:39 - Rachel: Haha not as bad as it could have been 🤣 I'm at my sister's now and I've just kept my scarf on 😜
01/05/2022, 17:28 - Adam: Embrace it 😉
01/05/2022, 17:38 - Rachel: I'm just not sure how my dad would feel about that 😜 Has anyone seen yours?
01/05/2022, 17:54 - Adam: Only seen my dad, he's not mentioned anything 🤣
01/05/2022, 17:55 - Rachel: Oh well he will have definitely seen them 🤣🤣
01/05/2022, 19:52 - Adam: 😘
01/05/2022, 19:52 - Rachel: Hey 😘
01/05/2022, 20:49 - Adam: Feel strange no kisses 🤣
01/05/2022, 20:51 - Rachel: Hahaha yeah it does 🤣
01/05/2022, 20:59 - Adam: <Media omitted>
01/05/2022, 21:03 - Rachel: I've looked at this gif for a while and I really can't tell what it is 🤣 Does it say something on the part that it zooms in on? My eyes are terrible 😜
01/05/2022, 21:07 - Adam: Lmao, just a dog showing how I feel right now
01/05/2022, 21:12 - Rachel: Oh I see, I feel you 🤣🤣
01/05/2022, 21:22 - Adam: <Media omitted>
02/05/2022, 06:39 - Rachel: I crashed so early last night, I was worn out 🤣
02/05/2022, 06:39 - Rachel: <Media omitted>
02/05/2022, 10:28 - Adam: Awwww, yeah I guessed 🤣

Did someone wear you out by any chance? 😉🤣
02/05/2022, 10:30 - Rachel: Hahaha yeah you kept me awake until a ridiculous time 😜
02/05/2022, 10:36 - Adam: Man has a ferocious appetite for it. 😉
02/05/2022, 10:36 - Rachel: I mean, I'm not complaining 😉
02/05/2022, 10:39 - Adam: Your cookie was delicious by the way, can't wait to partake again.
02/05/2022, 10:40 - Rachel: Oh well thank you, I can't wait either 😜 Do you want to stay over again on Friday?
02/05/2022, 10:53 - Adam: Evidently not 😉

I'd like that, Rachel
02/05/2022, 10:55 - Rachel: Great, we'll make a plan closer to the time 😊

Also, I had a look at cinema times for that film and it's only showing either Wednesday or Thursday night. It must be leaving the cinema soon. Could you handle seeing me twice in a week? 😜
02/05/2022, 11:04 - Adam: Which is more convenient for you, babes?
02/05/2022, 11:06 - Rachel: Maybe Wednesday night for the cinema and then you can still come over on Friday night if you want to?
02/05/2022, 11:06 - Adam: That's what I was thinking too 😘
02/05/2022, 11:07 - Rachel: Great 😘 Are you okay if we go to Cineworld because I have my unlimited card for there?
02/05/2022, 11:09 - Adam: Absolutely
02/05/2022, 11:10 - Rachel: Great thanks, it starts at 8.15 😊
02/05/2022, 11:11 - Adam: Yeah, I just looked. It'll prolly be violent you know 🤣
02/05/2022, 11:12 - Rachel: Oh I know, I hope you appreciate me coming to see it 🤣 Just as long as you're prepared for me to hide throughout it 😜
02/05/2022, 11:23 - Adam: Any excuse to get close to me
02/05/2022, 11:24 - Rachel: Damn, I hoped you wouldn't see through that
02/05/2022, 11:46 - Adam: No wandering hands during the film, lady
02/05/2022, 11:47 - Rachel: Of course not, I'm a good girl 😇
02/05/2022, 12:19 - Adam: Wish I could say I'd behave
02/05/2022, 12:21 - Rachel: Yeah I think out of the 2 of us, you're the one with the wandering hands 😜
02/05/2022, 12:23 - Adam: You just play with my chest hair, babe
02/05/2022, 12:23 - Rachel: I'm not really sure I should do that in the cinema though 😜
02/05/2022, 12:25 - Adam: You can play with my chest whenever you want love, can't say I'm bothered 🤣😘
02/05/2022, 12:26 - Rachel: Hahaha well that's good then, you don't need to tell me twice 😘
02/05/2022, 12:29 - Adam: Good girl
02/05/2022, 12:30 - Adam: Love being touched 😉
02/05/2022, 12:38 - Rachel: Haha really? Good I'm glad 😉
02/05/2022, 12:44 - Adam: You're still shy about touching my body though 😉😘
02/05/2022, 12:45 - Rachel: You still think I'm shy about it after Saturday? 😜
02/05/2022, 12:47 - Adam: I'm just very, very, very handsy Rachel 🤣 

Surprised I haven't scared you off. 😉
02/05/2022, 12:48 - Rachel: Yeah I have noticed 🤣 

I don't mind it when we're in private, you just can't do it in public which I think is fair 😜
02/05/2022, 13:57 - Adam: 😘
02/05/2022, 13:57 - Rachel: 😘
02/05/2022, 16:06 - Adam: <Media omitted>
02/05/2022, 16:08 - Rachel: Hahaha good 😉 Not bad for my first love bites right? 😜
02/05/2022, 17:10 - Adam: Hnnngh 😉
02/05/2022, 17:16 - Rachel: Well as I've said that I don't want any more, I can just keep giving them to you then 😜
02/05/2022, 17:17 - Adam: I can't make any promises baby, you see how passionate I get during the act. 😉🔥
02/05/2022, 17:20 - Rachel: Haha that's true and trust me, I'm not complaining 🔥 I just definitely can't have any for the next couple of weeks 🤣🤣
02/05/2022, 17:21 - Adam: I'll have to put them elsewhere on your body.
02/05/2022, 17:24 - Rachel: Yeah I think that seems like a fair compromise. Oh and that doesn't mean that you should stop kissing my neck either 🔥
02/05/2022, 17:46 - Adam: Now who's demanding. 😉😘
02/05/2022, 17:47 - Rachel: You have to be demanding sometimes 😉😘
02/05/2022, 17:50 - Adam: Ask and I'll happily give 😉🔥
02/05/2022, 17:51 - Rachel: That's what I like to hear 😉🔥
02/05/2022, 17:52 - Adam: I seriously cannot wait to tongue fuck you senseless again.
02/05/2022, 17:54 - Rachel: Oh I can't wait either. Only 4 days to go 🔥
02/05/2022, 17:57 - Adam: Agony
02/05/2022, 18:01 - Rachel: I know. It will be so worth it though 😉
02/05/2022, 18:16 - Adam: 4 days of throbbing 😫🔥
02/05/2022, 18:17 - Rachel: Are you gonna be able to behave in the cinema on Wednesday? 😜
02/05/2022, 18:28 - Adam: Absolutely not
02/05/2022, 18:30 - Rachel: I guess I'll just have to keep you in check
02/05/2022, 18:44 - Adam: You're far too gorgeous to accomplish that.
02/05/2022, 18:45 - Rachel: Oh well thank you, that was very smooth 😉 You are too and I still manage to control myself 😜
02/05/2022, 18:48 - Adam: 😉🤣🤣
02/05/2022, 18:49 - Rachel: I'm sure you'll be able to behave, I believe in you 😜
02/05/2022, 18:57 - Adam: Such faith
02/05/2022, 18:57 - Rachel: Well I guess we'll find out 🤣
02/05/2022, 19:31 - Adam: I only have one request of you
02/05/2022, 19:37 - Rachel: Yeah, what's that?
02/05/2022, 19:50 - Adam: Keep wearing the choker. 😍🔥🤣
02/05/2022, 19:54 - Rachel: I can do that 😉
02/05/2022, 20:00 - Adam: Good girl
02/05/2022, 20:03 - Rachel: I like it when you call me a good girl 🔥
02/05/2022, 20:52 - Adam: Hnnngh 🔥😉
02/05/2022, 20:56 - Rachel: 😉
02/05/2022, 22:32 - Adam: 😘
03/05/2022, 08:31 - Rachel: Morning 😘
03/05/2022, 09:35 - Adam: Ooof, morning kisses... I remember those 😉
03/05/2022, 09:57 - Rachel: Ooh me too, I could do with those right now 😉
03/05/2022, 15:27 - Adam: Anytime you want them babe, the special kisses as well 😉
03/05/2022, 15:29 - Rachel: Well that's an offer I can't refuse 😉
03/05/2022, 15:36 - Adam: Good girl 😘
03/05/2022, 15:37 - Rachel: 😘
03/05/2022, 16:01 - Rachel: How has your day been? Did it go okay when those people came yesterday?
03/05/2022, 16:05 - Adam: Ugh, nightmare. He won't see them, I'm waiting for a call back by his CPN.
03/05/2022, 16:06 - Rachel: Oh no, I'm so sorry. What will the CPN do?
03/05/2022, 16:06 - Adam: In other words, de-stress me 🤣😘
03/05/2022, 16:06 - Adam: I honestly don't know, they're the professionals though
03/05/2022, 16:06 - Adam: I'm out of my depth here it feels like
03/05/2022, 16:08 - Rachel: I promise I will do my best to de-stress you, that's what I'm here for 😘 

Yeah that makes total sense. You're effectively caring for him at the minute without having the qualifications to do that. I hope the CPN does something for him
03/05/2022, 16:23 - Adam: Damn, you're beautiful 😍
03/05/2022, 16:47 - Rachel: Oh well thank you, so are you 😍
03/05/2022, 18:54 - Adam: Special kisses for you tomorrow if you'll let me.

03/05/2022, 19:00 - Adam: 🔥 hnnngh 🤣
03/05/2022, 19:03 - Rachel: I'll still make you behave a bit though 😂 You don't want to miss your film 😜
03/05/2022, 19:05 - Adam: I want you 😉
03/05/2022, 19:06 - Rachel: Oh well that's good then, me too 😉 Only a few days left to wait 😂
03/05/2022, 19:09 - Adam: 😫😫🤣
03/05/2022, 19:12 - Rachel: It's gonna be a long 3 days 🙄 

I'm looking forward to seeing you tomorrow though
03/05/2022, 19:38 - Adam: Like you wouldn't believe
03/05/2022, 19:39 - Rachel: Good 😘
03/05/2022, 22:32 - Adam: What time would you like me tomorrow?
03/05/2022, 22:33 - Rachel: Well the film starts at quarter past 8 - are you coming here first or are we meeting at the cinema?
03/05/2022, 22:48 - Adam: I'll head to yours first
03/05/2022, 22:50 - Rachel: Okay no worries 😊 Whatever time you want is fine, it will only take like 10 minutes to get to the cinema. I'm finishing work at 4 and I'll just need some time to eat and make myself look pretty 😉
03/05/2022, 22:53 - Adam: Bout 6ish? Can give you your kisses

25/05/2022, 18:30 - Rachel: Well I'm happy for you to come over tonight if you want to. I'll just need a bit of time to get ready, I'm currently in my pyjamas with wet hair 😜
25/05/2022, 19:20 - Rachel: I've made myself decent if you do want to come over 😊
25/05/2022, 19:59 - Adam: Running a bit late, nurse arrived later than usual
25/05/2022, 20:02 - Rachel: Ah that's okay, don't worry!

25/05/2022, 20:27 - Adam: Get them toes ready for me, babes 😒
25/05/2022, 20:30 - Rachel: I haven't time to paint them I'm afraid, that's what happens when I'm not expecting you 😜
25/05/2022, 20:31 - Adam: 😒😒😒
25/05/2022, 20:31 - Rachel: Oh have you changed your mind about coming over now? 😜
25/05/2022, 20:32 - Adam: I'll have to find something else to play with

26/05/2022, 19:19 - Rachel: How's the rest of your day been?
26/05/2022, 19:37 - Adam: Nurse just left, Dr today suggested electro therapy, got 2 more docs hopefully tomorrow who'll likely get a section 3 rolling properly
26/05/2022, 19:54 - Rachel: Oh wow, how are you feeling about that? I think my dad had electro therapy when he was younger. At least they're gonna start putting things properly in motion now and hopefully it won't take too long
26/05/2022, 20:04 - Adam: I'll try anything babes 🤣🤦😘
26/05/2022, 20:06 - Rachel: Yeah that makes sense! I'm glad the doctors are finally doing something for you 😘
26/05/2022, 20:26 - Adam: Thank you baby girl 😘
26/05/2022, 20:26 - Adam: Are you up to anything nice?
26/05/2022, 20:27 - Rachel: Not much - just watching some TV and painting my nails, so they'll look nice for you tomorrow 😜 You?
26/05/2022, 20:43 - Adam: Hnnngh. 😍🔥
26/05/2022, 20:44 - Adam: Watching this Depp trial, some weirdo psychologist getting grilled
26/05/2022, 20:47 - Rachel: Oh yeah it's getting even more insane isn't it? They've examined some very weird people
26/05/2022, 20:59 - Adam: It's delicious 🤣
26/05/2022, 21:00 - Rachel: Yeah it's crazy 🤣 I haven't watched it all but I've seen a lot of it - I saw the doctor they examined the other day who was doing really weird things with his face 😜
26/05/2022, 21:09 - Adam: He got absolutely savaged, too arrogant to back down from his bullshit as well
26/05/2022, 21:11 - Rachel: Was he testifying in favour of her?
26/05/2022, 21:28 - Adam: He was
26/05/2022, 21:30 - Rachel: Ah I thought so. Her whole team have been a shambles throughout the trial
26/05/2022, 21:31 - Adam: Was sure if Depp hired the fucking A-Team or if they were just that terrible 🤣
26/05/2022, 21:31 - Rachel: Hahaha probably both 🤣 I think today was the last day wasn't it before the jury deliberate? It feels like it's been going on forever
26/05/2022, 21:32 - Adam: Yeah it was, watching heard getting grilled now
26/05/2022, 21:33 - Rachel: Good. Like we said before, there was definitely stuff on both sides but she seems awful
26/05/2022, 22:06 - Adam: What you watching on telly?
26/05/2022, 22:09 - Rachel: I was watching Taskmaster, have you ever heard of that?
26/05/2022, 22:22 - Adam: Ahem... Nope 🤣🤣
26/05/2022, 22:25 - Rachel: I didn't think you would have 🤣🤣 It's so good though! It's presented by Greg Davies and Alex Horne and each series, they have a group of 5 famous comedians who have to do really weird tasks and they get points based on how well they've done and one of them is crowned the winner at the end of the season. They're on the 13th series now, it's crazy that they can still come up with stuff 😂
26/05/2022, 22:46 - Adam: I've never even heard of it 🤣🤣
26/05/2022, 22:52 - Rachel: Oh another thing you're missing out on 🤣 It's so funny! I have so much to teach you 😜
26/05/2022, 23:09 - Adam: I'm missing out on your toes right now
27/05/2022, 07:30 - Rachel: Hahaha well not long to wait now 😉 And they're freshly painted for you

04/06/2022, 13:14 - Adam: He's my dad 🤦🤣🤣🤣

Awww, having a nice time with the family?
04/06/2022, 13:31 - Rachel: Oh god 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️ Was your sister still there when I dropped you off?

Yeah it was nice thanks! My mum's got a little slide in the garden so he was just playing on that 😊 I'll probably go back after my appointment. You should see the state of her street, they've really gone all out for this party 🤣
04/06/2022, 13:37 - Adam: Yeah she's still here now with me having a brew.

...did you go on the slide Rachel? 😉🤣

You should, don't be stuck in on your lonesome 😘
04/06/2022, 13:38 - Rachel: Aww that's nice, she okay?

Hahaha I would have loved to, he looked like he was having the best time 🤣🤣 I'm not sure how well I would have fit on it but I can try when I go back 😜
04/06/2022, 13:54 - Adam: She is yeah, heading off in a minute though.

That's my girl, show him how it's done 😉🤣
04/06/2022, 13:56 - Rachel: Aww nice. You got any plans for the rest of the day or just gonna sit in the garden?

Hahaha I'll do my best 😉🤣
04/06/2022, 14:35 - Adam: <Media omitted>

04/06/2022, 15:36 - Rachel: <Media omitted>
04/06/2022, 15:51 - Adam: 🔥😘
04/06/2022, 15:51 - Adam: Little beaut
04/06/2022, 15:54 - Rachel: Thank you very much 😘🔥 It probably won't look this nice when I next see you 🤣
04/06/2022, 16:06 - Adam: It fades that fast? 🤣
04/06/2022, 16:18 - Rachel: Oh no I meant the curls 🤣🤣
04/06/2022, 16:19 - Adam: Ahhhh of course, I'm a moron 🤣
04/06/2022, 16:19 - Rachel: I mean, I didn't want to say that 😜
04/06/2022, 16:59 - Adam: Sun's been crazy today
04/06/2022, 17:00 - Rachel: Oh I know, it's been so nice. I hope it stays nice tomorrow
04/06/2022, 17:33 - Adam: Beating down isn't it
04/06/2022, 17:39 - Rachel: Yeah definitely. You got any plans tomorrow?
04/06/2022, 17:41 - Adam: Not that I know of, you?
04/06/2022, 17:43 - Rachel: Not much, I'm going to a retreat in the morning but that finishes at 12. Maybe go for a walk or do something if the weather stays nice
04/06/2022, 17:43 - Adam: A retreat?
04/06/2022, 17:47 - Rachel: So retreats are basically where you just go and do yoga/meditation, they're good for anxiety. I went to one last year which was overnight at a spa hotel and we just spent the 2 days doing yoga and using the spa facilities, it was amazing! This one's just a mini one though, for 3 hours. 

You probably think I'm even more of a nerd now 🤣
04/06/2022, 18:12 - Adam: I love your nerdyness
04/06/2022, 18:13 - Rachel: Hahaha well thank you, I appreciate that 🤣
04/06/2022, 18:14 - Adam: You going with anyone?
04/06/2022, 18:15 - Rachel: No I'm just going on my own. I went to the overnight one last year on my own too. When I went to that one, I turned my phone off for the whole time I was there so I could really check out
04/06/2022, 18:17 - Adam: Check out 🤣 you're cute you
04/06/2022, 18:18 - Rachel: Hahaha it definitely worked, it was great 🤣
04/06/2022, 18:32 - Adam: Bless ya, you still at your mums
04/06/2022, 18:33 - Rachel: No I'm at home now, just catching up on Britain's got talent and then I'm gonna watch the concert thing on BBC for the jubilee later. What are you up to?
04/06/2022, 18:34 - Adam: Just come in from outside. Waiting on nurse now
04/06/2022, 18:38 - Rachel: Aww good, I hope it goes okay tonight

04/06/2022, 19:10 - Adam: <Media omitted>
04/06/2022, 19:13 - Rachel: I'll take that as a yes 😉😘
04/06/2022, 19:16 - Adam: Hell yes
04/06/2022, 19:17 - Rachel: Good, me too 😘🔥
04/06/2022, 19:21 - Adam: Yeah? 🔥
04/06/2022, 19:21 - Rachel: Of course, anything for you 🔥
04/06/2022, 19:31 - Adam: So... Yoga eh? 😉
04/06/2022, 19:32 - Rachel: Oh I'll be in all sorts of positions tomorrow 😉
04/06/2022, 19:47 - Adam: Making yourself all limber for me?
04/06/2022, 19:48 - Rachel: Yeah I should be nice and flexible for the next time you come over
04/06/2022, 19:57 - Adam: I'll have to make use of it
04/06/2022, 19:57 - Rachel: Yeah I think so, I can show you what I've learnt
04/06/2022, 20:14 - Adam: Such confidence
04/06/2022, 20:15 - Rachel: Yeah I think I'm improving 😜
04/06/2022, 21:44 - Adam: 🔥😘
04/06/2022, 21:46 - Rachel: 🔥😘
04/06/2022, 22:23 - Adam: Enjoy your weird concert thing? 🤣
04/06/2022, 22:25 - Rachel: Hahaha it's been great thanks, it's almost finished now. I mainly wanted to watch it because they had the casts of a few different West end musicals performing and Lin-Manuel Miranda briefly performed but it ended up being pretty good 🤣 How's your night been?
04/06/2022, 22:37 - Adam: Neeeeeeerd
04/06/2022, 22:39 - Rachel: Oh I was in full musical nerd mode. You should be gutted you missed it
04/06/2022, 22:46 - Adam: I am gutted
04/06/2022, 22:46 - Adam: Miss ya
04/06/2022, 22:47 - Rachel: I can tell you all about it next week, don't you worry 😜

I miss you too 😘
04/06/2022, 23:01 - Adam: Toes
05/06/2022, 07:31 - Rachel: I'm gonna start saying that I miss weird parts of you, like your ears or something 😜
05/06/2022, 10:20 - Adam: You miss my ears, babes? 🤣😉
05/06/2022, 12:10 - Rachel: That's always what I miss the most when you're not here 😂
05/06/2022, 13:57 - Adam: What is it about my ears that you like?
05/06/2022, 13:59 - Rachel: You just have great ears, what can I say. Great for always listening to my bullshit 😜
05/06/2022, 14:24 - Adam: An ear fetish, that's a new one for me. 😉🔥
05/06/2022, 14:24 - Adam: And I love your bullshit
05/06/2022, 14:25 - Rachel: Well I feel like I should have something to come back with when you say you miss my toes 🤣

Haha thanks, you're so cute 😘
05/06/2022, 14:28 - Adam: You're so cute, keeping your little kinks all secretive. 🔥
05/06/2022, 14:30 - Rachel: I don't really have an ear fetish, just so we're clear 🤣 I was just saying that because of the toe thing but you seem into it, so that's backfired 🤣
05/06/2022, 14:33 - Adam: I know you don't, but you've got some freaky shit you're keeping from me 🤣
05/06/2022, 14:34 - Rachel: Hahaha do you reckon? 😂 Maybe you'll have to find out what it is 😉
05/06/2022, 15:51 - Adam: I do reckon, you quiet ones are never that innocent
05/06/2022, 16:52 - Rachel: We'll see 😉🔥
05/06/2022, 17:04 - Adam: I want your clit on my tongue
05/06/2022, 17:28 - Rachel: Oh god me too 🔥🔥
05/06/2022, 18:29 - Adam: 🫠
05/06/2022, 18:33 - Rachel: Only a few days to wait 😘🔥
05/06/2022, 18:45 - Adam: Kisses all over
05/06/2022, 18:45 - Rachel: I love your kisses all over
05/06/2022, 18:46 - Adam: Good girl 🔥
05/06/2022, 18:47 - Rachel: How's everything been today?
05/06/2022, 18:53 - Adam: Quiet tbh
05/06/2022, 18:54 - Rachel: Oh that's good
05/06/2022, 18:54 - Adam: How'd your retreat go
05/06/2022, 18:55 - Rachel: Oh it was really good thanks! It wasn't so much yoga this time but it was mainly meditation. Very relaxing 😜
05/06/2022, 18:58 - Adam: You're cute 🤣
05/06/2022, 19:02 - Rachel: Hahahaha 🤣 They gave us some breakfast as well and then we did some meditation afterwards which was pretty much just having a nap, it was great 😂 They gave us pillows, blankets and eye masks
05/06/2022, 19:44 - Adam: 🤦 you paid for a sleep...
05/06/2022, 19:46 - Rachel: I mean, basically 🤣 It wasn't just that though, there was a workshop afterwards where she talked to us for a bit and we did some journalling 😜 It wasn't as good as the overnight yoga one but it was good for a few hours 😂
05/06/2022, 20:01 - Adam: You really are trying to live the sex and the city life
05/06/2022, 20:06 - Rachel: I'm trying so hard 🤣 Do you think it's working?
05/06/2022, 20:08 - Adam: Sure is babe, nailing it. 😎
05/06/2022, 20:08 - Adam: What did you put in your journal
05/06/2022, 20:13 - Rachel: Well thank you 😎 Maybe a better version of the women in that though - as much as I love the show, they're very 2 dimensional characters. All they talk about is shoes and men 🤣

Well she kind of guided us with it. She'd ask us questions about what we do to find inner peace and where we want to be in 5 years time. Things like that, there was a few questions. And then she gave people the chance to share with the group at the end which I of course didn't do 😂
05/06/2022, 20:28 - Adam: Ahem... You talked enough about our sex life to your friends. Not so much about shoes so I'll give you that. 😑

I think I've found your inner peace, might have tongue fucked it a few times. 🫠

Awww why didn't you share?! 🤣
05/06/2022, 20:30 - Rachel: Hahahaha a very good point, I can't argue with that 🤣🤣 I have talked about our sex life over cocktails so I'm pretty much there already.

I could not think of anything worse than reading from my journal in front of a room of strangers 🤣
05/06/2022, 21:05 - Adam: What do you write about 🤣
05/06/2022, 21:07 - Rachel: I've never done it before, I don't keep a diary or anything 🤣 I just answered her questions about finding my inner peace 😜 It was all very zen
05/06/2022, 21:27 - Adam: <Media omitted>
05/06/2022, 21:29 - Rachel: Oh hey 😉😘
05/06/2022, 21:39 - Adam: 🤣🤣😘
05/06/2022, 21:44 - Rachel: 😘🔥
05/06/2022, 21:48 - Adam: Toes babe, toes.

05/06/2022, 22:43 - Adam: Looking forward to it, enjoying our film nights 😉
06/06/2022, 07:31 - Rachel: Good me too 😉😘

06/06/2022, 12:18 - Adam: Ffs
06/06/2022, 12:18 - Adam: Fuck is that hospital?
06/06/2022, 12:19 - Rachel: Urgh nightmare 🤦‍♀️ Thanks for trying
06/06/2022, 12:23 - Adam: I'm sorry love
06/06/2022, 12:24 - Rachel: That's okay, it's not your fault. It's just annoying how long they're taking
06/06/2022, 12:25 - Adam: Why is nothing ever straightforward
06/06/2022, 12:26 - Rachel: Hopefully you'll be able to get through another time
06/06/2022, 16:36 - Adam: <Media omitted>

06/06/2022, 19:21 - Adam: Awww, you all soft and supple babes? 😘
06/06/2022, 19:22 - Rachel: Hahaha so soft and supple 🤣😘 Very relaxing
06/06/2022, 20:29 - Adam: Such a good girl
06/06/2022, 20:29 - Rachel: Hahaha I try 🤣😘
06/06/2022, 21:02 - Adam: So, you'll be wanting one of my heavy loads inside you now then? 😉
06/06/2022, 21:05 - Rachel: Well I think we've waited long enough 😉
06/06/2022, 21:06 - Adam: Hnnngh 🔥
06/06/2022, 21:09 - Rachel: I can stop being a nerd about it now 😜
06/06/2022, 21:44 - Adam: Nerd 🤣🤣😘

07/06/2022, 16:50 - Adam: He went in last night, I'm just catching up with things now. How are you baby? Out in this sun? 😘
07/06/2022, 16:54 - Rachel: Oh that's so great, I'm glad they've finally sorted it. How was he when he was going in? Yeah I'm not bad thanks, I've just been working - I'm finishing soon and then I'm going to my mum's for tea. I went for a walk on my lunch hour but apart from that, just been enjoying the sun through my window 😒
07/06/2022, 16:59 - Adam: He tried it on a bit, but he knew it was pointless fighting it.

Aww enjoy your tea 😘

Yeah I'm just getting washing done so I can get it out in the sun 🤣
07/06/2022, 17:00 - Rachel: Aww I hope it wasn't too stressful for all of you. Have they put him through for the longest section like they said they would?

Thank you 😘 Ooh very wise, the best time to do washing!
07/06/2022, 18:15 - Adam: I'm sure it's a section 3, will need to ring them to confirm
07/06/2022, 18:17 - Adam: Massage for you tomorrow babes?

14/06/2022, 20:26 - Adam: You'd drag me to all of them if you could 🤣

30/06/2022, 17:27 - Adam: Not at all, you love your cuddles
30/06/2022, 17:46 - Rachel: I do, I love your cuddles
30/06/2022, 19:04 - Adam: 😉
30/06/2022, 19:05 - Rachel: Was there something bothering you or on your mind which was keeping you up? You can talk about it if there was
30/06/2022, 20:51 - Adam: I've got all sorts tbh, prolly why I'm getting so many headaches

30/06/2022, 22:58 - Adam: How was your film 😘
30/06/2022, 22:59 - Rachel: Very disappointing 🤣 It was so long and I felt like there was nothing original in it, it was basically just like the last one but not very exciting
30/06/2022, 23:09 - Adam: Can't say I'm surprised 🤣
30/06/2022, 23:11 - Rachel: Yeah it definitely followed your idea of what sequels are like 🤣 They tried to make it this big thing of having Laura dern, Sam Neill and Jeff goldblum back but it was just quite dull overall. 

How was your night? 😘
30/06/2022, 23:36 - Adam: Just been a quiet one love 😘
01/07/2022, 08:01 - Rachel: Hey I'm sorry, I fell asleep.

What time are the visiting hours?
01/07/2022, 15:21 - Adam: 6:30
01/07/2022, 15:23 - Rachel: Oh well I can pick you up once you're done if you want? I won't be able to drop you off because I'm at becca and nate's but I'll be leaving theirs at about 7 when Isaac goes to bed
01/07/2022, 15:43 - Adam: Missing me that much? 😉
01/07/2022, 15:45 - Rachel: Hahaha I'm always missing you 😉 

For real though - it's up to you, just if you don't want to have to get a taxi back
01/07/2022, 17:57 - Adam: You up to anything tonight?
01/07/2022, 17:59 - Rachel: Just at becca and nate's now. It's Nate's birthday on Monday so we're having some food and birthday cake 😊 I'll be going home once Isaac's gone to bed though. You setting off to the hospital soon?
01/07/2022, 18:22 - Adam: Yeah, be getting a lift back off our mark. If I pop up tonight it'll be a little later than usual

03/07/2022, 13:17 - Adam: Mhmm, about 5 seconds into it you wobble forward a bit and you can see the panic 🤣
03/07/2022, 13:18 - Rachel: Hahaha I know, that really set me on edge for the rest of the time I was up there 🤣 The bench wasn't totally stable, it did keep wobbling a bit so every time I got up, I would only be up there for a bit and properly focused on keeping my balance while I danced 😂
03/07/2022, 13:45 - Adam: I can pinpoint the exact moment your blood runs cold lol
03/07/2022, 13:46 - Rachel: Hahaha I had visions of me falling flat on my face 😂 I was very grateful for the comfy shoes though 😜
03/07/2022, 13:59 - Adam: <Media omitted>
03/07/2022, 14:00 - Rachel: Oh wow 🤣🤣 I guess I'll take that as a compliment, thanks 😂
03/07/2022, 14:08 - Adam: So juicy
03/07/2022, 14:09 - Rachel: Well thanks, I'm glad you like it 🤣
03/07/2022, 16:20 - Adam: Best just after you've came and I stick my tongue all in your wet
03/07/2022, 16:22 - Rachel: Oh I love that so much 🔥🔥🔥
03/07/2022, 16:46 - Adam: Can feel it all around my tongue
03/07/2022, 16:48 - Rachel: Oh God you're making me wet now 😉🔥
03/07/2022, 17:32 - Adam: Like a cat that got the cream. 😉
03/07/2022, 17:33 - Rachel: You can come over tonight if you're free 😉

03/07/2022, 18:47 - Adam: Awwwww
03/07/2022, 18:47 - Adam: Just out with Carl, not sure when I'll get back
03/07/2022, 18:48 - Rachel: Oh no worries!
03/07/2022, 18:57 - Adam: Where were you supposed to be going?
03/07/2022, 18:59 - Rachel: I was just supposed to be taking Isaac to jump xtreme but he's tested positive for Covid today
03/07/2022, 18:59 - Adam: Awwwwwwwww
03/07/2022, 18:59 - Adam: Poor Baba
03/07/2022, 19:01 - Rachel: Yeah he's been really poorly, bless him. Nate's tested positive too but he's not doing too bad, he's had all his vaccinations. I just facetimed them though and Isaac seemed in pretty good spirits.

How's your night going, where have you been with Carl?
03/07/2022, 19:26 - Adam: Bless him, little warrior.

Having a brew, just in nandos now

05/07/2022, 16:46 - Rachel: That's very true, we're little oddballs together 🤣

05/07/2022, 17:04 - Rachel: Yeah she's good thanks! We've just been sat out in the garden for a bit. And my cats actually came to see me for once 🤣
05/07/2022, 17:11 - Adam: Awww bless 'em
05/07/2022, 17:12 - Rachel: How are your cats?

05/07/2022, 17:27 - Adam: Little bracken comes and goes
05/07/2022, 17:28 - Rachel: Yeah that's the big difference between dogs and cats, they only want attention on their terms x

05/07/2022, 21:45 - Rachel: Aww it's still as bad as it was? 😢
05/07/2022, 22:04 - Adam: Mhmmm
05/07/2022, 22:05 - Rachel: Maybe you should get it checked, it's been hurting for a while now

08/07/2022, 21:30 - Rachel: Ah fair enough, the usual stuff then 🤣 How is everything coming along, do you feel like you're getting somewhere now?
08/07/2022, 21:34 - Adam: I guess 🫠, you reading?
08/07/2022, 21:36 - Rachel: Aww that didn't sound too convincing but I'm glad you feel like you're getting there a bit 🤣 No I'm just watching a film at the minute. What are you up to?
08/07/2022, 21:38 - Adam: Just sat down on my computer, waiting for bedding to dry 🤣👎
08/07/2022, 21:39 - Rachel: So a wild Friday night for both of us then 😜
08/07/2022, 21:51 - Adam: Mhmmm
08/07/2022, 21:54 - Rachel: You looking forward to tomorrow?
08/07/2022, 22:26 - Adam: <Media omitted>
08/07/2022, 22:30 - Rachel: 😉😘
08/07/2022, 22:30 - Adam: What shit film are you watching 🤣
08/07/2022, 22:32 - Rachel: Hahaha how rude of you to assume it's shit 🤣

You're right though, it wasn't great 😅 It was called She's Gotta Have It, I don't know if you've ever heard of it? It's a Spike Lee film and it's supposed to be amazing, it's got 94% on rotten tomatoes, but I thought it was kinda boring
08/07/2022, 22:34 - Adam: 🤣🤣🤣 nah, I've not heard of it
08/07/2022, 22:39 - Rachel: Yeah you wouldn't have enjoyed it 🤣🤣 It was a black and white film and it was about this woman who is dating 3 guys at the same time but they all know about each other and want her to break up with the others. That was basically it, another film where not a lot really happened 🤣
08/07/2022, 22:48 - Adam: How utterly pointless 🤣
08/07/2022, 22:51 - Rachel: Yeah basically 🤣

It came out in the 80s so I think it may have been like revolutionary at the time because everyone in the cast was black and I guess there wasn't many films back then about women's sexuality. But aside from that, it was just very boring 🤣 You thought hello, goodbye and everything inbetween  was boring but this was worse than that 😜
08/07/2022, 22:56 - Adam: That is simply not possible
08/07/2022, 23:06 - Rachel: Hahaha you loved it 😉

You can pick the film next week, I think I need to make it up to you 🤣
08/07/2022, 23:07 - Adam: You can make it up to me in any way you want sweetheart 😉
08/07/2022, 23:08 - Rachel: Well I'm fairly certain I made it up to you later that night 😉
08/07/2022, 23:12 - Adam: It was a spectacularly bad film, babes 😉🤣
08/07/2022, 23:13 - Rachel: Oh so I still have more to do to make it up to you? 🤣
08/07/2022, 23:23 - Adam: You know I'm insatiable
08/07/2022, 23:24 - Rachel: Oh trust me, I know 😂🔥
08/07/2022, 23:44 - Adam: 🤣🤣🤣😘🔥
08/07/2022, 23:45 - Rachel: Not that I'm complaining 🤣😘🔥
09/07/2022, 00:02 - Adam: Such a good girl 🫠😍
09/07/2022, 00:03 - Rachel: Anything for you 😍😘
09/07/2022, 00:14 - Adam: My bedding is still a little damp 😭😭🤣
09/07/2022, 00:15 - Rachel: Oh no 🤣🤣
09/07/2022, 00:42 - Adam: FML 🤦
09/07/2022, 07:00 - Rachel: You would have just had to put up with damp bedding I'm afraid 😜
09/07/2022, 08:31 - Adam: Usually do after I'm finished with you.
09/07/2022, 09:33 - Rachel: I was thinking the exact same thing, I was waiting for you to say that 🤣
09/07/2022, 09:41 - Adam: Tongue fuck your little wet pussy. 🔥😉
09/07/2022, 09:42 - Rachel: Love that 😍🔥😍🔥
09/07/2022, 09:53 - Adam: Gotta busy morn, afternoon today, so be about 4 or 5ish when I'm back in. I know you wanted to play with the pussy cats before we went out (bout 7ish).  Would you like me to pick something up from Morrisons for you? Juice/drink etc? 😘
09/07/2022, 09:56 - Rachel: Oh yeah no worries! So what time do you want me to get to yours for then? 😊

Oh that would be great, thank you very much 😘
09/07/2022, 12:15 - Adam: Bout 5ish alright?
09/07/2022, 12:22 - Rachel: Yeah that works for me 😘
09/07/2022, 12:26 - Adam: Toes 😑
09/07/2022, 12:27 - Rachel: The shoes that I'm gonna be wearing aren't open toed so you'll have to wait until we get back from the party in afraid 😂
09/07/2022, 12:52 - Adam: Foot job 😑
09/07/2022, 12:53 - Rachel: 🤣🤣🤣

09/07/2022, 13:10 - Adam: 😉🔥
09/07/2022, 13:12 - Rachel: 😘🔥
09/07/2022, 13:55 - Adam: This weather is almost as fit as you
09/07/2022, 13:56 - Rachel: Oh how smooth, thank you 😉😘 We should go out somewhere tomorrow, it's gonna stay nice for a while
09/07/2022, 14:04 - Adam: We shall
09/07/2022, 14:05 - Adam: If you can stop dragging me In to bed that is 😑
09/07/2022, 14:07 - Rachel: Oh yeah sure, I'm the one that always wants to stay in bed all day 😜
09/07/2022, 16:01 - Adam: <Media omitted>
09/07/2022, 16:01 - Rachel: Oh no! 🙈🙈 Little terrors 😂
09/07/2022, 16:02 - Adam: Every time I turn around now
09/07/2022, 16:03 - Rachel: Yeah it seems like it's happening loads at the minute! I wonder where they're finding them all 😂

09/07/2022, 16:05 - Rachel: Yes that's perfect, thank you 😘😘
09/07/2022, 16:28 - Adam: Not a bloody clue, but I wish they'd stop 🤣

09/07/2022, 16:38 - Adam: <Media omitted>
09/07/2022, 16:38 - Adam: Butter wouldn't melt
09/07/2022, 16:38 - Rachel: Aww look at that innocent little face 😍😍
09/07/2022, 16:39 - Adam: You might get to see it if she doesn't bugger off on another hunt
09/07/2022, 16:41 - Rachel: Ooh I hope so! I'm gonna set off in a few minutes
10/07/2022, 19:14 - Adam: <Media omitted>

10/07/2022, 19:32 - Adam: My pleasure, sausage
10/07/2022, 19:33 - Rachel: I promise that I won't be weird when you come over on Wednesday 🙈
10/07/2022, 19:40 - Adam: 🤣🤣
10/07/2022, 19:42 - Rachel: 🤦‍♀️
10/07/2022, 21:14 - Adam: Wish you'd talk to me more 🤣
10/07/2022, 21:17 - Rachel: I know, I'm sorry. I was feeling quite emotional so I just figured that if I tried to talk to you, I'd just cry and neither of us wanted that 🤣 We'll have a proper chat about it on Wednesday and I'll talk to you, I should be less emotional by then 😅😘
10/07/2022, 23:52 - Adam: Okie doke 🫠🤣😘

11/07/2022, 16:22 - Adam: Needed a new hose?
11/07/2022, 16:23 - Rachel: Yeah it just needed a new hose. It's taken ages for them to send someone and he was in and out in a few minutes 🤦‍♀️ x
11/07/2022, 16:44 - Adam: Yeah, you just screw them on 🤣
11/07/2022, 16:58 - Rachel: What a nightmare 🤣🤣 I suppose the good part about renting is that they just send someone out and you don't have to pay for it
11/07/2022, 16:59 - Adam: Looks more complicated than it actually is 🤣
11/07/2022, 17:00 - Rachel: Yeah it's been leaking for weeks and it was so easy for him to fix 🤣
11/07/2022, 22:30 - Adam: Just had the biggest moth of all time in my kitchen
12/07/2022, 06:31 - Rachel: Oh no 🙈🙈 Did you manage to catch it?
12/07/2022, 09:53 - Adam: It flew back out, narrowly avoided our brams 🤣
12/07/2022, 12:37 - Rachel: Aww bless her, I'm surprised she didn't catch it for you 🤣
12/07/2022, 15:49 - Adam: Bramble is useless 🤣🙃
12/07/2022, 17:24 - Rachel: Hahaha you clearly needed Bracken's skills 🤣

30/07/2022, 23:43 - Rachel: Hahaha there's always some bullshit for you to listen to 🤣

The quiz that Catherine made was so good though. For one of the rounds, she'd scrolled through our Facebooks and found embarrassing posts from years ago and then we had to guess who had said it. It's always so embarrassing when old memories come up from when we were teenagers so that was great 🤣

05/09/2022, 07:36 - Rachel: I've got a UTI again 🙈🤣
05/09/2022, 12:44 - Adam: Ohhhh no baby 😔😘
05/09/2022, 12:46 - Rachel: I'm going to get my antibiotics later and I'll try not to have a breakdown about it this time 🤣 It's the weirdest thing, I was absolutely fine and then it just started last night out of nowhere 😒
05/09/2022, 12:49 - Adam: Mhmmm, what did you and buzz get up to 😒😑
05/09/2022, 13:04 - Rachel: Hahaha oh it's buzz's fault is it? 🤣
05/09/2022, 13:58 - Adam: Mhmmm, said it yourself it came outta nowhere 😒😑🤣
05/09/2022, 14:00 - Rachel: That must be it then 🤣 All those nights with him and he's betrayed me now 🤣
05/09/2022, 16:40 - Adam: Your poor ass is in for a beating the next couple of weeks 🙃

05/09/2022, 17:20 - Rachel: My pussy's okay thanks 😂😘 Now that I know what it is, it should be easier to handle - I left it almost a week before I called the doctor last time because I didn't know what it was. It's just very inconvenient, I barely slept last night because I needed to go for a wee so many times 🤣
05/09/2022, 17:21 - Adam: Is my dick worth it, love?
05/09/2022, 17:26 - Rachel: Completely worth it 😉😘

06/09/2022, 13:13 - Adam: Took dad to his appointment today, they fucked it up
06/09/2022, 14:33 - Rachel: Aww no what happened?
06/09/2022, 14:45 - Adam: They cancelled it or something and didn't tell me. Thursday now 🤦‍♂️
06/09/2022, 14:58 - Adam: <Media omitted>
06/09/2022, 14:59 - Rachel: Oh that's terrible 🤦‍♀️ Why would they just not tell you? What time is the appointment on Thursday?
06/09/2022, 14:59 - Rachel: 😉😘
06/09/2022, 15:00 - Adam: 11
06/09/2022, 15:00 - Adam: And because they don't know what they're doing

06/09/2022, 15:26 - Rachel: Oh it's fine thanks 🤣 I think it helps that I got the tablets straight away, it isn't really hurting like last time 🙈
06/09/2022, 15:39 - Rachel: I'm guess that you won't be able to come over tomorrow if you've got the appointment on Thursday? 😘
06/09/2022, 15:49 - Adam: Weren't you busy weds and Thurs?
06/09/2022, 15:53 - Rachel: No I'm busy Thursday but I'm free tomorrow. I'm in the office during the day so you wouldn't have been able to come tonight but I'll be finishing at 4 so I'll be free tomorrow evening. So it's up to you, you can stay over and I can drop you off early on Thursday but don't worry if you can't 😘
06/09/2022, 17:29 - Adam: I'm not sure, I might try and ring them tomorrow to get it pushed to next week. Annoyed with them tbh.

Also I do need my balls sucked on. 😑
06/09/2022, 17:31 - Rachel: Yeah I'm not surprised, they've messed you about a lot. Just let me know 😘

Hahaha I can do that
06/09/2022, 18:34 - Adam: Hnnnnnngh 🔥😑

07/09/2022, 18:25 - Adam: I can't tonight love, got dad's appointment tomorrow
07/09/2022, 18:25 - Rachel: Ah no worries, it's just because you said you were pushing it to next week. That's fine, hope the appointment goes well
07/09/2022, 18:29 - Adam: I wasn't able to
07/09/2022, 18:30 - Rachel: Okay no worries
07/09/2022, 18:30 - Adam: Oi
07/09/2022, 18:31 - Rachel: What?
07/09/2022, 18:31 - Adam: I've upset you
07/09/2022, 18:32 - Rachel: I'm not upset, I just don't understand why you didn't let me know that you couldn't move the appointment. Because the way you were talking last night made it sound like you were gonna come over tonight so if you weren't able to, you should have just sent me a quick text. That's all
07/09/2022, 18:35 - Adam: So I have upset you.

I said I might be able to get it changed, and I didn't make a promise that I could come round tonight.

But yes, I'm sorry I didn't text earlier.
07/09/2022, 18:40 - Rachel: No that's fine, I understand. It was never a guarantee, I just thought that you'd been able to because you didn't text me to say you couldn't. 

It's fine though, enjoy your night. I'll see you at the weekend
07/09/2022, 18:42 - Adam: 😘 Love you... 😉
07/09/2022, 18:42 - Rachel: Love you too 😘

07/09/2022, 19:32 - Adam: My gorgeous little sulky puss 😉🤣
07/09/2022, 19:34 - Rachel: I wasn't properly sulking 🤣 I think I'm within my rights to be a little upset that you didn't tell me you weren't coming 🤣
07/09/2022, 20:40 - Adam: <Media omitted>

11/09/2022, 16:58 - Rachel: How's your dad?
11/09/2022, 17:08 - Adam: He's okay
11/09/2022, 17:08 - Rachel: Oh good 😘
11/09/2022, 17:31 - Rachel: We've ordered some tea and when the doorbell rang, Isaac shouted 'Adam here' 🤣 He was so excited, bless him 🤣❤
11/09/2022, 17:37 - Adam: Awwwww 🤣🤣🤣😌💛
11/09/2022, 17:49 - Rachel: It's cute that he still remembers you, you'll have to see him again 🤣🥰
11/09/2022, 18:52 - Adam: I'm unforgettable 😉
11/09/2022, 19:33 - Rachel: That's very true 😉😘
12/09/2022, 11:02 - Rachel: Morning, how are you today? 😘
12/09/2022, 11:07 - Adam: Good morning cheeky face, I'm okay, struggled with sleep again a bit 🤣
12/09/2022, 11:14 - Rachel: Aww no, thinking about everything again? 😕
12/09/2022, 20:16 - Adam: <Media omitted>
12/09/2022, 20:17 - Rachel: How's your day been?
12/09/2022, 20:18 - Adam: Bank and usual shit. Just got back from Morrisons 😑
12/09/2022, 20:20 - Rachel: Ah fair enough, did you get everything done you needed to?
12/09/2022, 20:23 - Adam: To a degree, mince pies are out 🤣🤦‍♂️
12/09/2022, 20:24 - Rachel: Oh yeah I saw that in Asda earlier 🤣🤣 Even I think that's a bit early 🤦‍♀️
12/09/2022, 20:32 - Adam: Only decent part of Christmas
12/09/2022, 20:34 - Rachel: They are one of the many great things about Christmas 😉

They are one of the best parts though, I'll give you that. My flat will have a constant stash when it gets closer to Christmas 😜
12/09/2022, 20:37 - Adam: I'll eat your mince pie
12/09/2022, 20:38 - Rachel: You can turn anything into an innuendo, it's a great skill 🤣
12/09/2022, 20:48 - Adam: I love being in your rear end-o
12/09/2022, 20:49 - Rachel: Hahahaha amazing 🤣

I know you do 😉
12/09/2022, 21:14 - Adam: 🤌😌
12/09/2022, 21:16 - Rachel: Have you had any more luck with driving instructors? I had a quick look to see if I could find anyone for you and I found one who does the BL1 area with really good reviews, and the prices seem pretty standard 😊 It's called Darz driving school
12/09/2022, 22:16 - Adam: 300 for a block of 10 at that L driving school, there's a place called elite driving I'm gonna look more into as well.
12/09/2022, 22:20 - Rachel: Oh that's good then! A block of 10 at this Darz driving school is £230. So at least you've got a few options and you can get something booked 😘
12/09/2022, 23:09 - Adam: <Media omitted>
13/09/2022, 07:30 - Rachel: 😉😘
13/09/2022, 07:42 - Adam: Cheeky face
13/09/2022, 07:42 - Rachel: Morning 😘 Did you sleep any better last night?
13/09/2022, 07:44 - Adam: Good morning, sugar tits. And Noooooope, had a couple of hours 🤣
13/09/2022, 07:45 - Rachel: Aww no I'm sorry 😔 Have you ever tried sleeping tablets or anything?
13/09/2022, 07:51 - Adam: I have
13/09/2022, 07:51 - Rachel: And they didn't make a difference?
13/09/2022, 07:53 - Adam: Not as much as filthy blowjobs and powerful orgasms. 😑
13/09/2022, 07:54 - Rachel: Yeah that's true, that knocks you out all day 😂It's a wonder the doctors didn't prescribe that
13/09/2022, 07:56 - Adam: I'm the love doctor, and that was me prescribing it.
13/09/2022, 07:56 - Rachel: Ah I see, well I can't argue with your expertise
13/09/2022, 07:58 - Adam: Sexy bitch
13/09/2022, 07:59 - Rachel: 😘🔥

What are you up to today?
13/09/2022, 08:02 - Adam: Tidying after, his CPN is 'round at 10ish I think, bank again.
13/09/2022, 08:03 - Rachel: Oh good, I hope it goes well with his CPN. Are you gonna tell him the appointment last week was useless?
13/09/2022, 14:29 - Rachel: Hey how did it go this morning?
13/09/2022, 20:43 - Adam: He didn't ring before arriving, and I was out. Dad didn't answer door.
13/09/2022, 20:44 - Rachel: Aww no, you're joking 😕 Has he arranged to come another day?
13/09/2022, 21:02 - Adam: He's not no, so I'll have ring him tomorrow probably.
13/09/2022, 21:03 - Rachel: Oh I'm sorry. I'm surprised he didn't answer the door, I thought he was doing better
13/09/2022, 21:06 - Adam: 🤣🤣🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
13/09/2022, 21:07 - Adam: Is it tomorrow that you're out?
13/09/2022, 21:08 - Rachel: Hopefully you'll be able to arrange something else and just make sure that he calls you before he comes over. No I'm not out tomorrow
13/09/2022, 21:48 - Adam: Cheeky face 😘
13/09/2022, 21:49 - Rachel: So are you staying over on Thursday this week? 😘
13/09/2022, 21:49 - Adam: Of course I am
13/09/2022, 22:09 - Rachel: Great 😘 Have you had a think what you fancy doing during the day or are you really not bothered?🤣
13/09/2022, 22:19 - Adam: I haven't a clue babes. 🤣
13/09/2022, 22:31 - Rachel: Okay I'll throw out some suggestions and see what you fancy 🤣 We could go for lunch somewhere, we could do something during the day and then go for tea afterwards, we could go bowling, we could go to Manchester, we could go to the cinema. Or we could just chill at mine/yours for a bit during the day and then for tea in the evening. Any of this take your fancy? 🤣
13/09/2022, 22:54 - Adam: Bowling sounds good 😘🤣
13/09/2022, 22:56 - Rachel: Yeah we can do that! And then we could get some tea somewhere on middlebrook afterwards if you fancy? 😘
13/09/2022, 23:15 - Adam: Absolutely. Then some supper after 😘🔥
14/09/2022, 07:32 - Rachel: Sounds good to me 😉😘

Okay so the last couple of questions 🤣 I think you have to pre book it now so do you want 1 or 2 games and what time do you want me to book it for?
14/09/2022, 14:27 - Adam: 2 games, there's only two of us. And about 7ish?
14/09/2022, 14:28 - Adam: <Media omitted>
14/09/2022, 15:04 - Rachel: Oh yeah I can do. Are we gonna do something beforehand if we're booking it late, we could eat before if you want? I've booked the whole day off, I feel like it would be a waste to only meet up in the evening 😂 Unless you're doing something
14/09/2022, 16:40 - Adam: Our panda messaged about coming round. She hasn't got back to me yet though with a time.
14/09/2022, 16:42 - Rachel: Ah okay. I'll hold off on booking it yet then, just let me know
14/09/2022, 16:43 - Rachel: Or do you want me to just book it for 7 anyway and we can just go for tea if you're free?
14/09/2022, 16:50 - Adam: Yeah of course book it, I'm not waiting around for her like a nob.
14/09/2022, 16:52 - Rachel: Ah okay no worries. So I'll book it for 7 then and we'll say that I'll pick you up at around 5 ish to go for food but let me know if she hasn't been yet. Is that okay?
14/09/2022, 17:51 - Adam: What time were you thinking in the afternoon?
14/09/2022, 17:52 - Rachel: Erm I was thinking of booking it for like 3 ish and then going for food afterwards. But it's okay if you're not free at that time
14/09/2022, 17:53 - Rachel: Forgot the emoji 😘
14/09/2022, 19:15 - Rachel: All booked 😉😘

You know I was only joking when I said that you're never excited to see me don't you? I'm a bit worried it didn't come across like a joke but I didn't mean it
14/09/2022, 20:03 - Adam: Something's upset you, we'll talk about it tomorrow 😘
14/09/2022, 20:05 - Rachel: No there's nothing 😘 It must have just come out wrong, I'm sorry ❤
14/09/2022, 20:55 - Adam: 😑🤌
14/09/2022, 20:56 - Rachel: Love you 😉❤
14/09/2022, 21:26 - Adam: You goofball 🤣🔥
14/09/2022, 21:26 - Rachel: Such a nerd 🤣🤦‍♀️
14/09/2022, 21:29 - Adam: You all in a tizz, sugar tits? 🤣
14/09/2022, 21:29 - Rachel: I'm not in a tizz, I'm cool as a cucumber 😎
14/09/2022, 21:31 - Adam: Throttle yourself with that cucumber baby girl and chill 😉🤣🔥
14/09/2022, 21:32 - Rachel: Wow you really say the loveliest things to me 🤣🔥
14/09/2022, 21:36 - Adam: I'm gonna have to lick the goofiness right out of you tomorrow, aren't I?
14/09/2022, 21:37 - Rachel: Yeah I think that might be the only way to get rid of it
14/09/2022, 21:39 - Adam: I'm taking your ass again tomorrow, just so you know.
14/09/2022, 21:40 - Rachel: Well it is your birthday, you can have anything you want 😉
14/09/2022, 21:45 - Adam: I adore you, sausage
14/09/2022, 21:46 - Rachel: I adore you too
15/09/2022, 07:23 - Rachel: Happy birthday 😘
15/09/2022, 09:00 - Adam: You're cute you 🤣😉😘
15/09/2022, 09:02 - Rachel: I do try 😇😘
15/09/2022, 09:28 - Adam: Celebrate me baby 😉🔥🤣
15/09/2022, 09:29 - Rachel: I meant that in a purely innocent way of course 🤣😉
15/09/2022, 09:37 - Rachel: I write this really nice post for you and your only response to it is to mock me 🤣🤦‍♀️
15/09/2022, 09:39 - Adam: There is no innocence in our relationship 😑🔥
15/09/2022, 09:39 - Rachel: Hahahaha that's very true and that's the way we like it 😉🔥
15/09/2022, 09:41 - Adam: So excited 🤣
15/09/2022, 09:42 - Rachel: You are or I am? 😜
15/09/2022, 09:43 - Adam: You! 🤣🤣🤣
15/09/2022, 09:43 - Adam: You're so cute
15/09/2022, 09:44 - Rachel: I don't think it's a bad thing to be excited to see my boyfriend and celebrate his birthday 🤣🤣
15/09/2022, 09:44 - Adam: 😘😘😘
15/09/2022, 09:45 - Rachel: As someone who never really celebrates their birthday, you're not gonna know what's hit you today 😉😘
15/09/2022, 09:48 - Adam: <Media omitted>

15/09/2022, 14:00 - Rachel: Aww yeah I saw Mandy's status this morning. Is she okay?
15/09/2022, 14:47 - Adam: <Media omitted>
15/09/2022, 14:50 - Rachel: Oh bless her! Wow that's really swollen, do they know what's caused it?
15/09/2022, 14:52 - Adam: They're not sure yet, maybe glands
15/09/2022, 14:54 - Rachel: Aww bless her, I hope she's okay!
15/09/2022, 15:07 - Adam: Ready when you are tits 😘

17/09/2022, 17:36 - Rachel: Aww I'm glad she's doing a bit better. Is she still in hospital?
17/09/2022, 17:59 - Adam: She'll be home today I think
17/09/2022, 18:35 - Rachel: Oh that's great, I bet they'll both be relieved to be home
17/09/2022, 18:36 - Adam: What are you up to, trouble
17/09/2022, 18:57 - Rachel: Watching Dreamgirls 😂 We're just in Manchester now. What are you up to tonight?
17/09/2022, 19:55 - Adam: Just chilling 🤣
17/09/2022, 20:29 - Adam: <Media omitted>
17/09/2022, 20:29 - Adam: See... Daily mail never publishes bollocks 🤌😌
17/09/2022, 20:52 - Rachel: Ah well I can't argue with that then 🤣🤣
17/09/2022, 20:59 - Adam: Explains the massive smiles you have when I brew up those extra big loads for you. Baby girl 😘
17/09/2022, 22:31 - Rachel: Oh it always puts a smile on my face 😉😘 Now we know why 🤣

17/09/2022, 23:44 - Rachel: 😘🔥
17/09/2022, 23:45 - Adam: How come you're awake
17/09/2022, 23:46 - Rachel: We've only recently got back from Manchester, I've just got into bed. You really do think I'm an old lady don't you? 🤣
17/09/2022, 23:49 - Adam: You are an old lady
17/09/2022, 23:49 - Adam: With slippers
17/09/2022, 23:50 - Rachel: Hey there's nothing wrong with wanting to be comfy in my own home 😂 I hide them away when you come over though so you won't judge me
17/09/2022, 23:50 - Adam: Neeeeerd
17/09/2022, 23:50 - Rachel: You love my nerdiness
17/09/2022, 23:57 - Adam: Mhmm

19/09/2022, 13:03 - Rachel: 🤣😉😘
19/09/2022, 18:35 - Rachel: My mum noticed when I was at Becca and Nate's that there's a massive scrape on the front of my car - I've definitely not done that, someone must have hit it when we heard that bang from the car park earlier 😡 My dad said he's got some stuff he can fix it with so I hope he can, it would cost me a fortune I don't have if I have to take it to a garage 🤣🙈
19/09/2022, 18:55 - Adam: Bastards!
19/09/2022, 18:58 - Rachel: I know right, I'm so annoyed 🤣 I knew I'd heard something, it was loud and then I saw a van drive off. It was a massive mark too so they would have definitely seen it 🙃
19/09/2022, 19:00 - Adam: Fucking always something
19/09/2022, 19:02 - Rachel: I know right, it's not like we're in a cost of living crisis or anything 🤣🙈

That's enough of my moaning anyway! How's your dad?
19/09/2022, 19:28 - Adam: Ohhh baby 😘😘

And he's okay
19/09/2022, 19:29 - Rachel: Oh good, glad he's doing okay 😘

What are you both up to tonight?
19/09/2022, 19:30 - Adam: He's on computer, I'll just be chilling
19/09/2022, 19:31 - Rachel: Oh sounds nice 😘
19/09/2022, 19:32 - Adam: Yourself?
19/09/2022, 19:38 - Rachel: I'm just watching the masked dancer currently 🤣
19/09/2022, 19:48 - Adam: 🤣🤣🤣
19/09/2022, 19:49 - Adam: You're back home then?
19/09/2022, 19:49 - Rachel: I know I'm a nerd, you don't have to say 🤣🤣

19/09/2022, 20:00 - Adam: Awwwww

19/09/2022, 21:49 - Rachel: 🤣😘
20/09/2022, 16:27 - Rachel: Hey how's your day been?
20/09/2022, 18:45 - Adam: Groggy as fuck, struggled sleeping again 🤣
20/09/2022, 18:50 - Rachel: Aww no I'm sorry 😪 Have you always struggled with sleeping?
20/09/2022, 20:05 - Adam: Comes and goes
20/09/2022, 20:07 - Rachel: Yeah I guess it depends how stressed you are?
20/09/2022, 20:08 - Adam: Mhmmm. You looked proper cute on that pic 🤣😌
20/09/2022, 20:08 - Adam: Didn't see it before

20/09/2022, 20:53 - Adam: Bank, bank and more bank all this week
20/09/2022, 20:54 - Rachel: Oh yeah, that sounds stressful. Did you manage to sort that money for the council tax?
20/09/2022, 20:55 - Adam: Yeah, it's all paid, hence all the bank shit. Had the rent go out today as well. Then I'll have draw money out for the lessons
20/09/2022, 20:56 - Rachel: Ah that's good, at least that's one thing sorted 😘 It seems like it's just one thing after another doesn't it?
20/09/2022, 20:57 - Adam: How's the car looking sugar tits? 🤣😘
20/09/2022, 21:14 - Rachel: Yeah it's not too bad thanks 🤣🤦‍♀️ My dad managed to get a bit of the scrape off when he came over last night but he's gonna bring this stuff over next time which he thinks he can fix it with. He did say what it was called but I have no idea 🤷‍♀️
20/09/2022, 21:20 - Adam: I'll have a look 😘
20/09/2022, 21:22 - Rachel: Thank you 😘

It's looking much better than it was, I was having a bit of a stress when I first saw it 🤣 He's pretty sure he'll be able to fix it with this stuff though which is a relief 😂
20/09/2022, 21:32 - Adam: I wanna squeeze those big tits of yours, baby girl
20/09/2022, 21:34 - Rachel: Oh I want that too 🔥

23/09/2022, 20:39 - Rachel: I've just realised that I forgot to message you my bank details. They're 070436 26834065. So the ticket was £46 but like I said, you don't have to send that full amount if you don't want to because I know you wouldn't have paid that much 🤣 

Thank you 😘

30/09/2022, 17:51 - Adam: Little cheeky face
30/09/2022, 17:53 - Rachel: 😉😘
01/10/2022, 21:56 - Adam: <Media omitted>
01/10/2022, 21:56 - Rachel: 😉😘

I've just gone home so I might as well ambush you now and get it over with, if you're ready for it 🤣
01/10/2022, 21:57 - Adam: Hit me
01/10/2022, 22:06 - Rachel: Okay so I'm still feeling insecure about the fact that you text Helen which I know is just my issue which I'm gonna have to get over. Can I ask how often you text her? I assumed it was a lot because when you first told me about it, I asked if it was every day and you paused before you said no so I thought that meant it was almost every day. But you said last week that it's not a lot, so I'm just wondering. It also makes me feel kinda insecure to think that you'll be sat at home and just start thinking about her, which is when you'll text her to see how she is. I don't know if that's even the case, it might just be that you see something on Facebook and text her on the back of that. When she asks how you are, do you confide in her more than you do with me?

The main thing that I've been thinking about though is when you first told me, all you kept saying is that she has a boyfriend. So I was just starting to wonder if her boyfriend is the only thing stopping you from being flirty with her. Because I know you only broke up because you had to, with the distance and your dad not being well. So I was worried that you were wishing that you could still be with her and  I'm just like the second choice. But logically I know that's not true. When we first started seeing each other, you told me that you'd only ever been in love once so  were you not in love with Helen? Did you ever tell her that you loved her?

Okay I'm done now, there's been a lot going on in my head this past week 🤣🙈
01/10/2022, 22:48 - Rachel: I didn't get my plate 🤣🤦‍♀️
01/10/2022, 23:02 - Adam: Bloody hell!
01/10/2022, 23:05 - Rachel: We were clearly just all in a tizz 🤣🤦‍♀️

I'll try and remember next time 🤣
02/10/2022, 11:29 - Rachel: I'm going to see Isaac later so do you want me to stop and pick up my plate on my way home so you don't have to bring it next time you come over?
02/10/2022, 14:57 - Adam: I'll bring it round on Wednesday
02/10/2022, 14:57 - Rachel: Okay no worries
02/10/2022, 18:57 - Rachel: How's your day been?
02/10/2022, 19:48 - Adam: Groggy as fuck, trouble sleeping. How was Isaac? 🤣
02/10/2022, 19:50 - Rachel: Yeah I know what you mean, I didn't sleep great either. Yeah he was okay thanks! He was very grumpy when we first got there but he soon cheered up 🤣 But Becca called my Mum after we'd gone home because he ran face first into the couch and burst his nose open 🤦‍♀️ They said he's okay now though 🤣
02/10/2022, 20:27 - Adam: He's always up to mad shit that lad 🤣🤦‍♂️
02/10/2022, 20:28 - Rachel: Haha yeah, it probably won't stop him though 🤦‍♀️
02/10/2022, 20:50 - Adam: How come you couldn't sleep?
02/10/2022, 20:56 - Rachel: Oh just in my head all night. You?
02/10/2022, 20:57 - Adam: I can never sleep 🤣
02/10/2022, 20:58 - Rachel: Yeah that's true. Except when you're at mine 😂
03/10/2022, 04:03 - Adam: Mhmm
03/10/2022, 04:04 - Rachel: I clearly just wear you out 🤣😉

03/10/2022, 05:00 - Adam: How come you're awake
03/10/2022, 05:01 - Rachel: Struggled to sleep a bit again. And I've got to be up in a hour and a half because I'm in the office so this is gonna be a fun day 🤣😴
03/10/2022, 05:05 - Adam: Not like you to struggle with sleep
03/10/2022, 05:10 - Rachel: Yeah I know, I'm usually snoring away as soon as you turn off the lamp 🤣 It's just the past 2 nights
03/10/2022, 05:13 - Adam: Little snorer
03/10/2022, 05:13 - Rachel: Am I at least a graceful snorer? 😂🙈
03/10/2022, 05:16 - Adam: Sure 🤣🤦‍♂️
03/10/2022, 05:17 - Rachel: Hahaha I'm choosing to believe that obvious lie 🤣🤣
04/10/2022, 04:50 - Rachel: Are you awake?
04/10/2022, 04:50 - Adam: Mhmm 😩
04/10/2022, 04:51 - Rachel: I don't know how you cope with this every night, I'm exhausted already 🤣😴
04/10/2022, 04:51 - Adam: Shit innit
04/10/2022, 04:52 - Rachel: Yeah so shit. My brain won't switch off
04/10/2022, 04:52 - Adam: What you worrying about
04/10/2022, 04:55 - Rachel: I'm gonna be completely honest, I've been worrying about what happened with us the other night. We can have a chat about it properly when you come over on Wednesday if that's okay? I should have just spoken to you when you were at mine, that was stupid to try and do it over text
04/10/2022, 04:58 - Adam: You sausage. Get some sleep 🤣😘

And yeah, of course
04/10/2022, 05:01 - Rachel: I wish that I could, my brain is working in overdrive 🤣🤣

Thank you 😘 Watch what will happen now - once you're here and we've cleared everything up, I'll be snoring away as soon as my head hits your chest 🤣

04/10/2022, 17:17 - Adam: Cunts aren't they. They've only rolled back the top rate, they're still borrowing for the rest.
04/10/2022, 17:22 - Rachel: Oh are they? I've only seen the headline, you can explain it properly to me tomorrow 🤣 xxx
04/10/2022, 17:30 - Adam: Yeah, they're sly as fuck. Nothing can happen though til parliament is back in session next week

05/10/2022, 00:02 - Adam: Of course, it's a hard life
05/10/2022, 00:02 - Adam: 😩😩😩
05/10/2022, 05:36 - Rachel: Hahaha I don't know how you cope 🤣 Did you have a good night?

07/10/2022, 13:58 - Adam: Pissed it down all morning and afternoon
07/10/2022, 14:06 - Rachel: Oh I know, it's been so miserable today! I had to go to asda earlier and it was properly torrential
07/10/2022, 14:07 - Adam: Fucking hate it
07/10/2022, 14:21 - Rachel: Yeah I know, winter's not so bad when it's just cold but not wet 🤣 Did you have to go out in town in it?

10/10/2022, 20:49 - Adam: It gets worse
10/10/2022, 20:51 - Rachel: Oh yeah I watched the rest of it, that's terrifying
10/10/2022, 20:56 - Adam: I had no idea
10/10/2022, 20:57 - Rachel: No neither did I. I've seen tik tok challenges and the dances but I had no idea guys were paying them, let alone that there's underage girls on there. It's crazy that it's never been reported before
11/10/2022, 09:52 - Rachel: Are you feeling any better today? 😘

11/10/2022, 09:57 - Rachel: Oh I see how it is 🤣🤣 Maybe we do need to find her a boyfriend 🤣
11/10/2022, 10:02 - Adam: Bless her, we all have needs Rach. I mean look how bad you were 😉🤣
11/10/2022, 10:04 - Rachel: Hahahaha in your mind, I was just constantly frustrated 🤣🤣
11/10/2022, 10:08 - Adam: Sooo frustrated
11/10/2022, 10:09 - Rachel: Just constantly angry at the world. All this time, I just needed you to go down on me 🤣😉
11/10/2022, 10:32 - Adam: I suffocate in your pussy
11/10/2022, 10:35 - Rachel: You certainly do, you put some serious work in. And I greatly appreciate it 😉😘

11/10/2022, 21:07 - Adam: Nah, couldn't be arsed paying it, we don't watch telly
11/10/2022, 21:08 - Rachel: Ah yeah that's fair enough, there's no point if you don't watch TV. That's just another bill you don't need 🤣🤦‍♀️
12/10/2022, 10:53 - Adam: Headache from barely sleeping again 🤦‍♂️🤣
12/10/2022, 10:53 - Adam: How are you, sexy?
12/10/2022, 10:55 - Rachel: Oh no! Well I bought you some more Paracetamol for tonight, just in case 😘

It's much healthier, I promise 😘
12/10/2022, 13:15 - Adam: 🤣🤣🤦‍♂️
12/10/2022, 13:21 - Rachel: I won't force you to get everything out all at once, we can do it in little bits 🤣😉
12/10/2022, 13:22 - Adam: Shhhhh, anal. 😑
12/10/2022, 13:23 - Rachel: Oh that would help you to feel better would it? 🤣🤣
12/10/2022, 14:22 - Adam: Perhaps 😑🤣
12/10/2022, 14:23 - Rachel: Hahaha well it's worth a shot 🤣😉

16/10/2022, 19:53 - Rachel: They don't tell you who had the most votes, just the people who are in the bottom 2. They haven't done the dance off yet but it's Kym Marsh and Matt Goss who need to dance again, and then the judges will send someone home. I reckon Matt will probably be going
16/10/2022, 21:08 - Adam: Yeah, he was shit
16/10/2022, 21:09 - Rachel: Yeah he was kicked off, his dance off routine wasn't any better than his dance last night. And at least we don't have to look at his plastic face anymore 😅
16/10/2022, 21:10 - Adam: 🤣🤣

17/10/2022, 18:45 - Adam: Someone came round to her instead
17/10/2022, 18:46 - Rachel: Oh really? I imagine that might have been a little better and slightly less daunting. How's she doing?
17/10/2022, 18:46 - Adam: Said she's been crying all day
17/10/2022, 18:46 - Adam: Dad's full of his cold still

01/11/2022, 21:21 - Rachel: Yeah we like to be prepared 🤣 I've told you how organised Becca is - she's been researching over the past few days and she had pages and pages of notes, comparing all the prices of the different hotels 🤣🙈
02/11/2022, 14:32 - Adam: Pissing it down all day 😫😡
02/11/2022, 14:33 - Rachel: Oh I know, it's so miserable 😣 What have you been up to today?

06/11/2022, 20:20 - Adam: Should have been the other guy
06/11/2022, 20:22 - Rachel: Yeah she definitely didn't deserve to go, it should have been Tony. But she was in the dance off against Molly and she was never gonna beat her
07/11/2022, 16:09 - Adam: How's your chesty
07/11/2022, 16:37 - Rachel: Yeah I'm feeling so much better today thanks, I'm back at work now. How are you feeling? 😘

09/11/2022, 16:41 - Rachel: Aww no, again? 😪🙈 I'll give you a massage tonight 😘
09/11/2022, 16:42 - Adam: I'm exhausted love, I won't be able to tonight
09/11/2022, 16:42 - Adam: Gonna order some melatonin from the states I think
09/11/2022, 16:42 - Rachel: Ah okay no worries. I'm in the office on Friday so it will just have to be Friday  night
09/11/2022, 16:56 - Rachel: I'm gonna be completely honest with you, I'm not very happy that you're cancelling on me again. Especially so soon after cancelling last Friday. I completely understand that you're tired but I didn't cancel on you when I was off sick last week. I'm not looking to start an argument, I just thought it was better to let you know rather than let it fester all night
09/11/2022, 19:36 - Adam: I'm unpleasant to be around when I'm operating on no sleep.
09/11/2022, 19:40 - Rachel: I never think that you're unpleasant to be around so if that's the only reason you cancel when you're tired, you don't need to worry about that. I just want to spend time with you and it makes me feel like you're not bothered about seeing me when you cancel
09/11/2022, 19:52 - Adam: I've never been around yours when my sleep is this shit. And please don't think that
09/11/2022, 19:54 - Rachel: Okay that's fine then. Hope you sleep better tonight
09/11/2022, 19:56 - Adam: I'll stay over Saturday and Sunday, your full weekend we wanted. Hopefully I can get it sorted by then for a bit 😘
09/11/2022, 19:57 - Rachel: Sorry I can't do this Saturday, that's when we're going to that escape room
09/11/2022, 20:08 - Rachel: We can just do Sunday then and not do Friday. We could do the full weekend next weekend instead maybe
09/11/2022, 20:20 - Adam: We'll bake a cakey
09/11/2022, 20:23 - Rachel: Yeah no worries. I was gonna ask if you wanted to go to the Christmas markets on that Saturday as well?
09/11/2022, 21:13 - Adam: Sounds good
09/11/2022, 21:14 - Rachel: Okay great
09/11/2022, 21:56 - Adam: 😘
09/11/2022, 21:57 - Rachel: 😘
09/11/2022, 21:58 - Rachel: Matt Hancock has gone into the jungle tonight and the other campmates have given him a very frosty reception, they are not happy 🤣🙈
09/11/2022, 22:40 - Adam: Complete wanker isn't he 🤣
09/11/2022, 22:42 - Rachel: 🤣🤦‍♀️
09/11/2022, 22:59 - Adam: Being paid a fortune for it apparently
09/11/2022, 23:03 - Rachel: Yeah that doesn't surprise me. He's been voted for the next trial so he probably will be every day
10/11/2022, 15:00 - Adam: It's just embarrassing ain't it 🤣🤦‍♂️
10/11/2022, 15:02 - Rachel: Yeah you should watch it, it's very funny trying to watch him be likeable 🤣 He was singing Ed Sheeran within a few minutes of being in there 🙈
10/11/2022, 15:06 - Adam: I will never watch it 🤣
10/11/2022, 15:07 - Rachel: Hahaha yeah I didn't think so, I won't make you watch it 🤣
10/11/2022, 17:43 - Rachel: Did you sleep any better last night?
10/11/2022, 17:49 - Adam: Haven't slept, had about an hour's nap
10/11/2022, 17:52 - Rachel: Aww no, what do you think is causing it?
10/11/2022, 18:00 - Adam: Just go through these phases
10/11/2022, 18:01 - Rachel: Sounds like a nightmare
10/11/2022, 19:21 - Rachel: Do you fancy going out for tea tomorrow night and then I'll drop you back at home afterwards?
11/11/2022, 08:09 - Adam: Where were you thinking love?
11/11/2022, 12:02 - Rachel: Wherever you fancy? I'm in the office until 5 but I can come and get you after that

11/11/2022, 22:34 - Rachel: Yeah I don't blame you 🤣
12/11/2022, 14:21 - Adam: Excited for your escape room? 🤣
12/11/2022, 14:22 - Rachel: Hahaha yeah I can't wait 🤣🤣 I was useless at the physical stuff last time but not too bad at the puzzles so I'm hoping to be a little bit helpful 🤣 And we managed to escape with a few minutes to spare last time 🤣💪
12/11/2022, 14:27 - Adam: Not useless at our physical stuff 😬
12/11/2022, 14:28 - Rachel: Hahahah I'm not sure that's gonna be one of the challenges though unfortunately 🤣 But thanks, I'll take the compliment 😉
12/11/2022, 14:34 - Adam: I could give you physical challenges 😬
12/11/2022, 14:35 - Rachel: I'll gladly take on any challenge you set me 😏

13/11/2022, 08:39 - Rachel: Aww bless you, I hope you had a good sleep 😘 Hahaha that's exactly what it was like 🤣 I'll tell you all about it properly later but every time I solved anything, I would just turn to Catherine all excited to make sure she saw 🤣🤦‍♀️
13/11/2022, 12:05 - Rachel: Do you know what time you'll be coming over later? 😘 We need to set off from mine at 4
13/11/2022, 14:08 - Adam: Just getting my dad sorted, will order taxi in a min 😘

14/11/2022, 15:48 - Adam: The determination is admirable
14/11/2022, 15:49 - Rachel: I would be doing all this stuff anyway, I'm just taking advantage of being able to do it with a boyfriend 🤣

18/11/2022, 16:24 - Adam: Depressing shit 🤣
18/11/2022, 16:26 - Rachel: Yeah so grey and miserable 🤣 This is the bad part of winter 🙈

18/11/2022, 17:23 - Adam: Cats have fleas 😑
18/11/2022, 17:24 - Rachel: Aww no you're joking 😔 Do you not have any of the flea stuff from the vets?
18/11/2022, 17:28 - Adam: I have the spray, just got back from mozzas with the spot on and the tablets
18/11/2022, 17:30 - Rachel: Oh hopefully that gets rid of them then!
18/11/2022, 17:31 - Adam: Tablets kicked in, they're going apeshit now 🤣
18/11/2022, 17:32 - Rachel: Aww bless them 🤣 Yeah my cats hate when I have to put that flea stuff on their necks
18/11/2022, 18:32 - Adam: Waiting on taxi
18/11/2022, 18:32 - Rachel: Okay no worries 😘
18/11/2022, 18:36 - Adam: Get kettle on, tits 😘
18/11/2022, 18:37 - Rachel: Yes Sir 🤣😘
20/11/2022, 16:17 - Rachel: 😘😘
20/11/2022, 16:27 - Adam: 😘😘
20/11/2022, 16:31 - Rachel: Are the pussy cats okay?
20/11/2022, 16:49 - Adam: They are 🤣
20/11/2022, 16:52 - Rachel: Aww good, bless them 🤣 xxx
20/11/2022, 18:45 - Adam: Your mum alreet?
20/11/2022, 18:52 - Rachel: Yeah she's not too bad thanks 🤣 We ended up staying for tea at Becca and Nate's because Isaac was sick but he's feeling much better now after throwing up 🤦‍♀️ How's your dad?
20/11/2022, 20:47 - Adam: He's okay 😘
20/11/2022, 20:47 - Rachel: Good 😘😘
20/11/2022, 21:41 - Adam: How's your dad feeling?
20/11/2022, 21:50 - Rachel: Yeah he was okay thanks 😘 He said he's going back to work tomorrow though and they're making him work an extra night, he usually works 4 nights a week and he has to work 5 now. So I imagine he'll probably start feeling worse again 🤦‍♀️
20/11/2022, 21:56 - Adam: Absolute cunts
20/11/2022, 21:58 - Rachel: I know. Surely they can't make him work an extra night to make up for being off sick, there must be some law against that
20/11/2022, 22:13 - Adam: He won't fight his corner though
21/11/2022, 06:31 - Rachel: No of course he won't 🤣🤦‍♀️
21/11/2022, 12:27 - Rachel: How are you, did you sleep okay?
21/11/2022, 12:50 - Adam: Yea, cold as fuck today ain't it
21/11/2022, 13:00 - Rachel: Oh I know, it's horrendous 🙈 I couldn't get to sleep for ages last night because it was so cold, I had to change into warmer pyjamas and then put a blanket on top of my duvet
22/11/2022, 08:44 - Rachel: Do you fancy going out for drinks on Friday night if you're free?
22/11/2022, 13:22 - Adam: Are you in your head? 🤣😘
22/11/2022, 14:09 - Rachel: Maybe a little bit 🤣🙈 Well it's just because I had a really great time when we were in the pub in Manchester but it was spoilt a bit when we were in Bolton, and you didn't get to have a proper night out. So I was thinking we could go for a proper drink and a dance 😊 It would be fun and we're always just doing stuff that I want to do
22/11/2022, 19:04 - Adam: 🤣🤣🤣 had a feeling you were
22/11/2022, 19:06 - Rachel: You know me 🤣🤣 We don't have to, it was just an idea. Or we could just go for a few drinks in one of the pubs on Blackburn Road
22/11/2022, 19:55 - Adam: 🤣🤣😘😘😘
22/11/2022, 19:58 - Rachel: Is that a yes or a no? 🤣🤣
22/11/2022, 20:14 - Rachel: You don't have to answer now, I'm seeing you tomorrow anyway 🤣
22/11/2022, 20:36 - Adam: Of course 😘😘
22/11/2022, 20:37 - Rachel: Okay great, we can sort out what you want to do 😘😘
22/11/2022, 20:43 - Adam: No I mean we will 🤣😘
22/11/2022, 20:44 - Rachel: No I know, I meant you could decide if you just want to go to a pub on Blackburn Road or if you want to go in town 🤣😘
22/11/2022, 20:46 - Adam: Ahhh not sure, we'll figure something 😘🤣🤣
22/11/2022, 20:49 - Rachel: Oh yeah we don't have to decide that now, I won't be a total psycho 🤣🤣
22/11/2022, 20:56 - Adam: You flapping babe? 🤣🤣😘
22/11/2022, 20:56 - Rachel: Me? Never 🤣😇
22/11/2022, 21:05 - Adam: What's up lovey?
22/11/2022, 21:07 - Rachel: No nothing's up, I promise 😘😘 I was in my head a bit when I text you this morning but I'm okay now 🤣😘

23/11/2022, 12:36 - Adam: 🤣🤣🤣
23/11/2022, 12:47 - Rachel: Oh and don't forget to bring your toothbrush back 🤣
23/11/2022, 16:01 - Adam: Bloody effort, no idea why they put a screw in it
23/11/2022, 16:02 - Rachel: Yeah that's so annoying that you'll have to do that every time the batteries need changing
23/11/2022, 16:04 - Adam: Fuck that, screw not even needed. it's got a rubber seal in it. Pushing it back in felt almost as tight as your pussy and ass babe.
23/11/2022, 16:12 - Rachel: You've got issues 🤣🤣🤣
23/11/2022, 16:58 - Adam: <Media omitted>

24/11/2022, 21:50 - Adam: Bloody eckers 😔😔😔

Aww I hope you've both had a good day. Did you ask her if she wants to come?
25/11/2022, 15:40 - Adam: She can't make it this time, but she'll arrange for the next
25/11/2022, 15:42 - Adam: <Media omitted>
25/11/2022, 15:43 - Rachel: No worries 😘

25/11/2022, 16:08 - Adam: Sarah's been to New York btw
25/11/2022, 16:11 - Rachel: Ooh has she?? I'll have to talk to her about that when I meet her. Has she convinced you that it's gonna be amazing? 🤣
25/11/2022, 16:27 - Adam: 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
25/11/2022, 16:29 - Rachel: Just prepare yourself for the extent to which I will bullshit to her about it 🤣🤣
25/11/2022, 18:01 - Adam: I'll start walking down in a bit, be about 10 to
25/11/2022, 18:03 - Rachel: Okay I'll probably get there before you but I'll just get us some drinks and see if I can get a table
25/11/2022, 18:25 - Rachel: I just got asked for ID 🤣
25/11/2022, 18:27 - Adam: Oooooo

27/11/2022, 17:31 - Rachel: I'm catching up on last night's I'm a celebrity and Matt keeps putting his jacket everywhere to make sure that the number you call to vote for him is facing the cameras 🤣🙈
27/11/2022, 17:34 - Adam: 🤣🤣😘

My dad had already left so I didn't actually see them. But then I went to my Mum's to get my washing and woke her up from a nap 🤣🙈
27/11/2022, 17:52 - Adam: Aww bless her
27/11/2022, 17:52 - Rachel: Yeah apparently Isaac was sick twice again while she was looking after him
27/11/2022, 17:53 - Adam: Your Becca still giving her shit? 🤣🤦‍♂️
27/11/2022, 17:54 - Rachel: Hahahah she didn't say but hopefully she can't blame her for this if he's been sick all week 🤣 She can usually find a way though 🤣🤦‍♀️
27/11/2022, 19:24 - Adam: My hat at your place? 🤣😘
27/11/2022, 19:25 - Rachel: I haven't found it yet 🤣🤔 I'll keep looking though 🤣

I can't have you not wearing that hat anymore, that is unacceptable 🤣😘
27/11/2022, 20:58 - Rachel: I still can't find it 🤔 I'll have a look tomorrow if it's in my car
27/11/2022, 21:04 - Adam: Could be, I'm sure I had it when we went Asda 🤣🤦‍♂️
27/11/2022, 21:05 - Rachel: Yeah I'm sure you did too 🤣 What about when we went to Costa?
27/11/2022, 21:10 - Adam: Hmmm, no I don't think I did
27/11/2022, 21:11 - Rachel: I'll keep looking 🤣🤦‍♀️ It's definitely not in your bag that you brought the clothes in? 😅
27/11/2022, 21:23 - Adam: Nah, it might be at the side of the couch
27/11/2022, 21:24 - Rachel: I'll let you know if I find it 🤦‍♀️ I'll be very upset if its gone, I will demand you get a new one 🤣
27/11/2022, 21:25 - Adam: I should have another in the house somewhere, but that's hiding as well 🤦‍♂️
27/11/2022, 21:26 - Rachel: How has that happened? 🤣🤦‍♀️
27/11/2022, 21:28 - Adam: Because I'm a twat and always lose things
27/11/2022, 21:29 - Rachel: Because you're a man? 🤣
27/11/2022, 21:32 - Adam: Debatable
27/11/2022, 21:33 - Rachel: Debatable that you're a man? 😜
27/11/2022, 21:33 - Adam: Mhmmm 🤣
27/11/2022, 21:33 - Rachel: I dunno, you seem all man to me 😉🤣

27/11/2022, 22:04 - Rachel: Oh and I need to get something out of my brain - you know I was only joking before when I was saying that you never say anything nice to me don't you? 🤣🙈
27/11/2022, 22:32 - Adam: Of course 🤣🤦‍♂️😘
27/11/2022, 22:34 - Rachel: Oh good 🤣😘 I thought that you would have but you know me, I had to make sure 🤣🤦‍♀️
27/11/2022, 22:34 - Adam: Sausage
27/11/2022, 22:35 - Rachel: 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️

Did you want any of the other pictures and videos or did you just want those ones?
27/11/2022, 22:38 - Adam: Just those 😘
27/11/2022, 22:39 - Rachel: No worries 😘 Feel free to crop me out of that last one 🤣🙈
27/11/2022, 22:39 - Rachel: That one's really nice of you but my face ruins it 😅
27/11/2022, 22:41 - Adam: 🤣🤣🤣
27/11/2022, 22:42 - Rachel: 🤣🤦‍♀️

28/11/2022, 02:02 - Adam: <Media omitted>
28/11/2022, 06:30 - Rachel: Hahahah accurate 🤣🤣
28/11/2022, 08:18 - Rachel: I've found your hat in my car 🤣
28/11/2022, 09:04 - Adam: Thought so 🤣🤣🤦‍♂️
28/11/2022, 12:33 - Rachel: You can get it on Wednesday 🤣🤦‍♀️

Good luck in your lesson. Text me afterwards and let me know how it goes 😘
28/11/2022, 13:10 - Adam: Yeah, I was wiping windshield with it. 🤣🤦‍♂️
28/11/2022, 16:06 - Rachel: Ah yeah of course 🤣🤦‍♀️ We should have known it would be there 🤣
28/11/2022, 20:59 - Rachel: How did your lesson go?
28/11/2022, 21:49 - Adam: He didn't turn up, and they're acting retarded now.
28/11/2022, 21:50 - Rachel: What? How can he just not turn up??
28/11/2022, 21:58 - Adam: Not a clue, waited and no turn up. I asked *very* politely if something happened and it reads like i got a snotty answer back. Saying I didn't confirm it, despite me in the text asking for 30 hrs, potentially more.

Biting my tongue for a sec here, as this isn't someone looking for over a grand of my money it seems.
28/11/2022, 21:59 - Rachel: That's so annoying! So what are you gonna do now? Have you rearranged it or are you gonna have to find a different instructor?
28/11/2022, 22:02 - Adam: Dunno, I'm in a mood right now.
28/11/2022, 22:03 - Rachel: Yeah I'm not surprised. Maybe message him again tomorrow when you've slept on it
28/11/2022, 22:10 - Adam: Proper boiled my piss tbh
28/11/2022, 22:18 - Rachel: Yeah I bet it did. It seems like it was a misunderstanding but they shouldn't have been snotty and acted like it was your fault
28/11/2022, 22:23 - Adam: I'm not arsed about the no show, mistakes/misunderstandings happen. However me texting them again asking if everything was okay evidently shows my interest.
28/11/2022, 22:24 - Rachel: Oh yeah definitely. They should have then accepted their mistake and tried to rearrange it with you
28/11/2022, 22:31 - Adam: 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
28/11/2022, 22:33 - Rachel: You'll just have to try again, don't let this put you off 🤣🤦‍♀️
29/11/2022, 16:07 - Rachel: We're taking Isaac out for the night and he just turned to me and said 'Auntie Rachel is very very weird' 🤣 I mean, he's not wrong 🤣🙈 xxx
29/11/2022, 20:58 - Adam: Want me to beat him up for ya 🤣
29/11/2022, 21:03 - Rachel: Hahaha yeah he was being so savage 🤣 After he said that, he said 'Auntie Rachel is in my way' whilst I was literally just sat there 🤣🤣
29/11/2022, 21:58 - Adam: Awww bless ya 🤣
29/11/2022, 21:59 - Rachel: How are you, feeling better than yesterday?
29/11/2022, 22:00 - Adam: Meh, just been quiet
29/11/2022, 22:00 - Rachel: Yeah I'd noticed you were quiet. Have you heard from him at all today?
30/11/2022, 07:31 - Rachel: The film starts at half 6 tonight so can you get to mine for about half 5?

07/12/2022, 11:28 - Rachel: Oh that's good then! Hopefully that will work 😘 I mentioned to them about you getting some of the Advocat which I put on monthly and they said you can't buy that, you'd have to register with them and they can put some on for them and then give you some more. Maybe you could think about registering them sometime so you know you're covered for the future 😘 It doesn't cost anything to  be registered with them, you just have to pay for the stuff

12/12/2022, 09:23 - Adam: Bless ya 🤣
12/12/2022, 09:38 - Rachel: It was still cute though 🤣😘

12/12/2022, 12:54 - Adam: She had to cancel it today, sidestreets she wanted to take me on are icy
12/12/2022, 12:54 - Adam: She'll try and fit me in another day this week
12/12/2022, 13:27 - Rachel: Oh yeah that makes sense 😘 You wouldn't want to drive in this on your second lesson anyway 🙈
12/12/2022, 13:29 - Adam: Couldn't sleep last night so I stayed up for nothing 🤣
12/12/2022, 13:44 - Rachel: Aww no 🙈 Were you worried about it?
12/12/2022, 14:43 - Adam: Nah, had a nap earlier 🤣
12/12/2022, 14:46 - Rachel: Aww good, are you feeling alright then? 🤣
12/12/2022, 18:00 - Rachel: We've arrived and so far, it is all I dreamed 😍 Driving up to our cottage was so pretty and I was getting so excited, like a kid in the back of the car 🤣
12/12/2022, 18:42 - Adam: All you dreamt?... 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤦‍♂️😘
12/12/2022, 18:44 - Rachel: Yeah but it sounds cuter to say dreamed 😂
12/12/2022, 20:52 - Adam: Bless you 🤣
12/12/2022, 20:52 - Rachel: I'm an oddball, I know 🤣
12/12/2022, 20:59 - Adam: Very slippy out there
12/12/2022, 21:05 - Rachel: Oh yeah it was pretty slippy when I drove to my Mum's earlier 🙉 Have you had to go out in it?

12/12/2022, 21:52 - Rachel: Aww what a nightmare 🙈 Has your day been okay then?
12/12/2022, 22:31 - Adam: Just groggy from sleep being fucked. How's your night? 🤣😘
12/12/2022, 22:33 - Rachel: Aww no 😞😘 Did your nap not help?

Yeah it's good thanks 🤣 We've had a chilled night tonight - Isaac will probably have us up early tomorrow morning and then we're doing memory making and then meeting Father Christmas in the afternoon 🤣🤩
12/12/2022, 22:38 - Adam: I always feel worse after naps 🤣

Memory making 🤦‍♂️🤣🤣
12/12/2022, 22:42 - Rachel: Oh yeah so do I, naps always make me feel so much more groggy 🤦‍♀️

Hahaha I'm still not 100% sure what that entails but I can't wait to find out, I'll send you pictures of creation 🤣 And then after Santa, we're getting pizza and me and Isaac are gonna make a gingerbread house. What a magical day 🤣🤣🤩
13/12/2022, 04:05 - Adam: Want your toes
13/12/2022, 06:59 - Rachel: Missing my toes at 4am were you? 😉😂
13/12/2022, 08:04 - Adam: Mhmm, amongst other things

13/12/2022, 09:20 - Rachel: Isaac was just watching me put my make up on and I said 'Is Auntie Rachel pretty?' and he went 'no not yet' 🙃
13/12/2022, 09:20 - Adam: Want me to uppercut him?
13/12/2022, 09:23 - Rachel: I think you should, it was so savage 🤣🤣 I asked him a couple of times and he kept saying no 🙈 I asked him again when I was ready and he said yes then so that's something 🤣
13/12/2022, 09:25 - Adam: Need your clit babes 😌🤌
13/12/2022, 09:26 - Rachel: It needs you too 🔥
13/12/2022, 09:27 - Adam: Gonna fuck your ass when you get back, just so you know
13/12/2022, 09:28 - Rachel: If you behave yourself
13/12/2022, 09:28 - Adam: Bitch you do as you're told
13/12/2022, 09:31 - Rachel: Yes Sir
13/12/2022, 11:47 - Rachel: So we've just got back from Memory Making and it turns out it was the children doing the painting, I didn't get to create anything 💔 It was fun though, Isaac had a good time 🤣
13/12/2022, 12:31 - Adam: You should have insisted 🤣🤣😘
13/12/2022, 12:32 - Rachel: I know, I should have made a scene 🤣🤣 No one can say no to my sulky face 😂😇
13/12/2022, 12:43 - Adam: You were gutted weren't you 🤣
13/12/2022, 13:00 - Rachel: Only slightly 🤣😇
13/12/2022, 14:54 - Adam: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤦‍♂️
13/12/2022, 14:54 - Rachel: How's your day been? 😘
13/12/2022, 15:36 - Adam: It's been okay I suppose
13/12/2022, 15:37 - Rachel: Have you been up to much? Has Janet come back to you about arranging another lesson?
13/12/2022, 19:45 - Adam: Just hibernating in the house mostly, and aye, tomorrow afternoon. 🤣
13/12/2022, 19:55 - Rachel: I don't blame you, it's been a cold one today 🙈 Oh that's good then, I'm glad she's managed to rearrange it for you 😘
13/12/2022, 20:51 - Adam: Side Roads are still crazy slippy, wouldn't be surprised if it's cancelled again
13/12/2022, 20:53 - Rachel: Yeah that's true, the main roads are fine but the smaller roads aren't. I suppose it depends where she's planning on taking you. Fingers crossed 😘
14/12/2022, 06:54 - Rachel: Hope you slept better last night 😘
14/12/2022, 11:25 - Adam: Up and down 🤣 how early you are 🤣🤣😘

19/12/2022, 12:58 - Adam: Bloody hell love 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️😔
19/12/2022, 13:00 - Rachel: What a nightmare 🤣🤦‍♀️ It's gonna cost a fortune as well but what can you do 🤦‍♀️
19/12/2022, 16:21 - Rachel: How was your lesson today? 😘

19/12/2022, 18:45 - Adam: Your mum's FB post. 🤣🤣
19/12/2022, 18:46 - Rachel: Which one? 🤣
19/12/2022, 19:25 - Adam: The dogshit

20/12/2022, 13:41 - Rachel: Has all the ice disappeared from your street now? It's a gone round here
20/12/2022, 14:36 - Adam: Aye 😘
20/12/2022, 14:38 - Rachel: Oh that's good then, at least you don't have to worry about falling anymore 😘
20/12/2022, 16:34 - Adam: Still grey and shitty though 😔🙅‍♂️
20/12/2022, 16:35 - Rachel: Oh yeah it has been miserable today 🙈 It was pretty warm yesterday, like 12 degrees. Practically summer weather 🤣
20/12/2022, 17:08 - Adam: Still not much Christmas shit in town
20/12/2022, 17:23 - Adam: Currently grinning my ass 9ff in coffee shop.  Some Indian lad looks like he's on a date with a young radical feminist 🤣🤣
20/12/2022, 17:23 - Adam: Agreeing with everything she's saying.
20/12/2022, 17:31 - Rachel: Hahaha just saying everything she wants to hear is he? 🤣🤣
20/12/2022, 17:34 - Adam: Ohh it's wonderful
20/12/2022, 17:36 - Rachel: Would you have agreed with me if I expressed my feminist views on our first date? 🤣
20/12/2022, 17:43 - Adam: Lightly challenged you and taken the piss. Which would have gotten you frustrated and wet
20/12/2022, 17:53 - Rachel: Hahaha you're not wrong 🤣😉 Because I've got issues 🤣

What sort of thing was she saying, how hard core feminist are we talking?
20/12/2022, 18:08 - Adam: Looked fresh out of sixth form, so a bull ring and all white men are the devil kind of shit.  Chatting politics and abortion, which is always a good icebreaker 🙅‍♂️🤦‍♂️
20/12/2022, 18:10 - Rachel: Oh wow 🙈🤦‍♀️ Even if I didn't tell you how all men are garbage humans on our first date 🤣
20/12/2022, 18:12 - Adam: Feminism was a mistake, you're all just crying out for a firm hand, a stiff cock and a dog lead.
20/12/2022, 18:14 - Rachel: Yeah I think all my feminist views went out the window the second I put that dog lead on 🤣 I've let the feminist inside me down
20/12/2022, 19:37 - Adam: Good girl
20/12/2022, 19:38 - Rachel: So proud of yourself 🤣😉😘
20/12/2022, 20:05 - Adam: My theory is undefeated
20/12/2022, 21:08 - Rachel: Absolutely 🤣😘

They've made even more of a mess of that junction now. I was just driving back from my Mum's and all the traffic lights were out on Blackburn Road and crompton way was completely closed so I couldn't get to my flat. I had to pull up somewhere and ring my Mum to direct me a different way - I somehow still managed to get lost but I've just got home now, over an hour after I set off 🙃
20/12/2022, 21:28 - Adam: Through town then up tonge moor?
20/12/2022, 21:31 - Rachel: Yeah that's the way I ended up going. She directed me past the delivery office and up Tonge Moor that way but I took a wrong turn and ended up in town anyway 🤣 You should have seen the level of stress, I could feel my face turning a beautiful shade of red 🙈
20/12/2022, 22:05 - Adam: Why get stressed? 🤣🤣🤣🤦‍♂️
20/12/2022, 22:07 - Rachel: You know me, when do I not get stressed? 🤣 I thought I might be lost forever 🤣🙈
20/12/2022, 22:19 - Adam: You're such a sausage 🤣
20/12/2022, 22:22 - Rachel: I may have been slightly dramatic 🤣🤦‍♀️
21/12/2022, 15:39 - Adam: Ugh, feel rough after that nap
21/12/2022, 15:41 - Rachel: Oh no 😪 I don't know why you bother napping, it never makes you feel better 😂🙈 Hopefully you'll feel better after a brew and some painkillers! I've still got painkillers at mine too
21/12/2022, 17:21 - Adam: <Media omitted>
21/12/2022, 17:26 - Rachel: 😉😘

22/12/2022, 18:06 - Rachel: Aww bless you, that sounds like a nightmare 🙈 That's okay, don't worry about it 😘
22/12/2022, 18:49 - Rachel: I started making the brookies at about half 4 and they're finally in the oven 🤣😴
22/12/2022, 18:50 - Adam: Didn't have me to mix 🙅‍♂️
22/12/2022, 18:52 - Rachel: That's exactly what it is, I needed your excellent mixing skills! And your strong arms 😉🤣
23/12/2022, 08:12 - Rachel: It's dark and cold this morning 🙈
23/12/2022, 12:42 - Adam: I got straight back into bed after my pee and brew 🤣🤣
23/12/2022, 12:43 - Rachel: Hahaha I don't blame you, I would have if I could 😂 Do you need to go in town in this? 🙈
23/12/2022, 16:38 - Adam: Have I fuuuuck, gonna be a mad Christmas eve dash for me tomorrow babes 🤣🤣🙅‍♂️
23/12/2022, 16:41 - Rachel: Yeah I don't blame you 🤣🤣 Fingers crossed it's not as rainy tomorrow 🙈
23/12/2022, 16:49 - Adam: 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️
23/12/2022, 19:13 - Rachel: Town's gonna be full of men doing their last minute shopping 🤣
23/12/2022, 22:34 - Rachel: I'm thinking I might pick you up at about 5 tomorrow, is that okay?
24/12/2022, 10:12 - Adam: Mhmm 😘😘😘
24/12/2022, 10:34 - Rachel: Great see you later 😘😘
24/12/2022, 12:13 - Adam: What's the age limit on toys for Isaac? 🤣
24/12/2022, 12:14 - Rachel: Well he's 2 and a half so I'd say anything maybe 2/3 and above might be safe 🤣 Feel free to send me pictures of anything you find if you want to make sure

24/12/2022, 12:29 - Adam: <Media omitted>
24/12/2022, 12:31 - Rachel: Which one are you preferring?
24/12/2022, 12:31 - Adam: That last one has the most moving parts
24/12/2022, 12:32 - Rachel: The only thing with that one is that it's 4+ and you know what Becca's like 🤣🙈
24/12/2022, 12:33 - Adam: 🤣🤣 it's cool as fuck
24/12/2022, 12:34 - Rachel: Oh it definitely is cool! That's the only thing I was thinking 🤣 She might be fine with it, I'll leave it up to you 🙈 The first dinosaur looks pretty cool too
24/12/2022, 12:35 - Adam: Lmao
24/12/2022, 12:37 - Rachel: I'll let you decide 😂 As long as it doesn't look like there's loads of parts he can choke on, that's the only thing she's bothered about
24/12/2022, 12:42 - Adam: What a ballache lol

29/12/2022, 11:30 - Adam: Absolute sausage 🤣
29/12/2022, 11:34 - Rachel: I have to go round to look after Isaac for an hour or so tonight so I can pick you up on the way home. I'm not sure exactly what time but it should be the usual sort of time, I'll let you know when I'm setting off 😘

07/01/2023, 20:30 - Rachel: She was basically saying that me getting stressed about things is just part of my personality, but it's not a bad thing or a personality flaw like I think it is. So to just own it and to just try and make a joke out of it if someone says I'm getting stressed, rather than getting offended and upset. So I'll try, I promise 🤣😘
07/01/2023, 20:38 - Adam: <Media omitted>

11/01/2023, 20:10 - Adam: Which in particular?
11/01/2023, 20:16 - Rachel: The ones you took in the minster please. I didn't really get any good ones but I know you took a few. And any others that you think are really nice please 😘

11/01/2023, 20:35 - Rachel: Thank you very much 😘 xxx
12/01/2023, 07:21 - Adam: I fell bubbo straight away. 🤣🤣
12/01/2023, 07:31 - Rachel: Aww did you, that's good 🤣🤣 Do you feel better now? I should have done that but I stayed up for a bit 😴
12/01/2023, 08:15 - Adam: I do yeah, how long did you stay up for? 🤣
12/01/2023, 08:16 - Rachel: Good 😘 I went to bed at about half 10. Way past my bedtime 🤣
12/01/2023, 08:26 - Adam: What were you up to? 🤣
12/01/2023, 09:04 - Rachel: Well I got in at about 8 and I decided to watch one episode of gilmore girls before I went to bed but then when that finished, I was too cosy in my Hedwig blanket and I didn't want to get up 🤣 So I spent about an hour on my phone on the couch trying to find the willpower to get up and then when i went into my room, I hadn't unpacked yet so I had to do that before I went to bed 🤣🤦‍♀️
12/01/2023, 10:46 - Adam: What did you need to unpack? Your makeup stuff? 🤣
12/01/2023, 10:47 - Rachel: Everything in my suitcase, I had a lot more shit than you 🤣🙈
12/01/2023, 16:32 - Rachel: <Media omitted>
12/01/2023, 16:34 - Adam: Hmmm I just tried sharing it
12/01/2023, 16:35 - Rachel: No it still says the same thing, that's weird. I'm intrigued what it is now 🤣
12/01/2023, 16:37 - Adam: https://fb.watch/h-YbQymQUR/?mibextid=DTfniY
12/01/2023, 16:37 - Adam: Just my dad and abi
12/01/2023, 16:44 - Rachel: Aww that's a shame that it won't show up for me, I'll like it anyway 🤣
12/01/2023, 16:45 - Rachel: God that guy is a walking red flag 🤦‍♀️
12/01/2023, 16:46 - Adam: Which guy
12/01/2023, 16:47 - Rachel: That link you just sent me is of a girl talking about her first date with an abusive ex boyfriend. Is that not what it was supposed to be? 🤣
12/01/2023, 16:48 - Adam: Nope 🤣🤣🤣
12/01/2023, 16:48 - Adam: Your Facebook is cursed 🤣
12/01/2023, 16:49 - Rachel: I did wonder why you'd sent it to me but didn't want to question it, I just watched the whole video 🤣🤣🤣 It's clearly trying to reinforce my views of men being garbage humans 🤣
12/01/2023, 16:50 - Adam: 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤣
12/01/2023, 16:51 - Rachel: Was it supposed to be the thing you've tagged me in of your dad and Abi?
12/01/2023, 16:51 - Adam: Mhmm
12/01/2023, 16:53 - Rachel: Facebook just really doesn't want me to see that for some reason 🙈 So you must have been so confused when I replied saying that he was a walking red flag, it would have sounded like I was talking about your dad 🤣
12/01/2023, 21:49 - Adam: Nah, thought you'd been mooching on our Mandy's Facebook, wondered if there was anything good happening.
12/01/2023, 21:51 - Rachel: Aww no, not this time 🤣 I can be your spy again but hopefully you won't need it 🤦‍♀️ Have you spoken to her?
12/01/2023, 22:29 - Adam: Nah not yet
13/01/2023, 06:31 - Rachel: Ah fair enough 😘
13/01/2023, 08:32 - Rachel: I was just driving to work and a teeny tiny spider dropped down from a web and stopped right next to my face, and I momentarily forgot how to drive 🙃
13/01/2023, 08:33 - Adam: Please don't do that 😬😬😬
13/01/2023, 12:27 - Rachel: Luckily it was as I was pulling into the car park so I was driving slowly, but I had a bit of a flap 🤣🙈
13/01/2023, 16:32 - Adam: Bloody hell Rach 🤦‍♂️
13/01/2023, 16:33 - Rachel: I lived to tell the tale ✌️ I hope your driving lesson was okay today, the weather's been horrendous 🙈
13/01/2023, 16:34 - Adam: We had to reschedule it to Monday
13/01/2023, 16:37 - Rachel: Oh really, the weather was too bad?
13/01/2023, 16:38 - Adam: She was running massively late for an appointment or something.
13/01/2023, 16:52 - Rachel: Aww fair enough! That's good that she's rearranged it straight away for you
14/01/2023, 16:53 - Adam: Be about 7ish
14/01/2023, 16:53 - Rachel: That's fine 😘
14/01/2023, 18:26 - Adam: Omw

15/01/2023, 18:18 - Adam: Bless her 🤣
15/01/2023, 18:18 - Rachel: It didn't take her as long as I was expecting, she just needed to sulk for a bit and she's fine now 🤣 xxx
16/01/2023, 09:58 - Rachel: It's snowing again 🤣😍 I imagine the floor is too wet for it to stick properly so it will probably just turn to slush, if anything 🤣🙈
16/01/2023, 15:22 - Adam: Plenty of nobheads out on the road today 🤣
16/01/2023, 15:24 - Rachel: Aww no what a nightmare 🤣🙈 What were you doing today?
16/01/2023, 15:42 - Adam: She got a new car, so getting used to it. Just had dickheads being impatient and undertaking
16/01/2023, 15:44 - Rachel: Oh really? Yeah it can take a little bit of time but you'll get used to it 😘 Urgh people can be so awful towards learners, like they weren't once learners themselves 🙄 I hope it wasn't too bad though! When's your next lesson?
16/01/2023, 15:53 - Adam: Yeah, nice ford.

Nah, I was fine, just people are retarded. 🤣 And next Monday
16/01/2023, 15:54 - Rachel: They certainly are 🤣 I'm glad it still went okay 😘
16/01/2023, 18:05 - Rachel: You know how we were both feeling down yesterday? Apparently it's Blue Monday today which is the day people feel the most depressed throughout the year. So that explains it, we were just starting a day early 😂🙈
16/01/2023, 20:52 - Adam: Sounds about right for us 🤣
16/01/2023, 20:59 - Rachel: Absolutely, we never do things exactly like other people 🤣
17/01/2023, 05:33 - Adam: Woke up at 3 🤣🤦‍♂️
17/01/2023, 07:31 - Rachel: Aww no what a nightmare  🤦‍♀️ Could you not get back to sleep?
17/01/2023, 08:33 - Adam: Fell asleep early, and nah I couldn't 🤣
17/01/2023, 08:45 - Rachel: Aww at least you managed to fall asleep early 🙈 Have you got any plans for today, are you going into town?
17/01/2023, 13:15 - Adam: Yeah I'm in town now. 😘
17/01/2023, 13:17 - Rachel: Oh good 😘 What do you need to get done today?
17/01/2023, 14:46 - Adam: Money as usual, and just got back from Morrisons
17/01/2023, 14:55 - Rachel: Ah fair enough, glad you got everything done
18/01/2023, 12:38 - Rachel: Please don't forget to come a bit earlier tonight so we can go to the cinema 😘
18/01/2023, 13:01 - Adam: What times the film again
18/01/2023, 16:07 - Rachel: It starts at quarter past 7
18/01/2023, 16:45 - Adam: Okie dokie babe
18/01/2023, 16:47 - Rachel: 😘
18/01/2023, 18:12 - Adam: Omw
18/01/2023, 18:13 - Rachel: Okay 😘
18/01/2023, 18:18 - Adam: Blurp
18/01/2023, 18:18 - Rachel: Blurp
19/01/2023, 11:48 - Adam: Wear grippy shoes on your walk
19/01/2023, 11:58 - Rachel: Oh is it slippy? 🙈 Yeah I'll get my good boots on, thanks 😘
19/01/2023, 12:28 - Rachel: I've just been for my walk and I didn't fall 😎 How was it in town?
19/01/2023, 14:50 - Adam: Good girl 🤣 heading home now, just had a brew with Carl
19/01/2023, 14:55 - Rachel: Oh really, did she get back in touch with you? How was it?
19/01/2023, 17:19 - Adam: Bit of a shitty attitude at the start, but it got better
19/01/2023, 17:39 - Rachel: Oh good, I'm glad it got better 😘 You didn't mention you were going to see her, was it a spontaneous thing?
19/01/2023, 18:02 - Adam: Last night, wasn't sure if it would happen though
19/01/2023, 18:13 - Rachel: Oh really, you didn't think she'd be up for it?
19/01/2023, 19:53 - Adam: Bit flakey
19/01/2023, 19:57 - Rachel: Ah yeah that makes sense. I'm glad it was okay
19/01/2023, 21:42 - Adam: <Media omitted>
19/01/2023, 21:44 - Rachel: 😉😘
20/01/2023, 18:35 - Adam: Omw
20/01/2023, 18:35 - Rachel: 😘😘

21/01/2023, 18:26 - Rachel: 😉😘
21/01/2023, 18:55 - Adam: 🤣🤣😘
21/01/2023, 18:56 - Rachel: There are no bruises yet 🤣🙈
21/01/2023, 18:56 - Adam: Bless ya
21/01/2023, 18:57 - Rachel: What am I like 🤣🤦‍♀️
21/01/2023, 19:05 - Adam: Cute
21/01/2023, 19:06 - Rachel: I'm glad you still think that, even after the way I wiped you out 🤣
21/01/2023, 22:47 - Adam: How could I not 🤣
22/01/2023, 09:29 - Rachel: Hahaha well good, I appreciate that 🤣🙈 It was an impressive fall this time
22/01/2023, 18:11 - Adam: How's your side feeling? 🤣
22/01/2023, 18:17 - Rachel: Oh it is very sore today 🤣🙈 What about you, did you hurt yourself?
22/01/2023, 18:17 - Adam: I seem alright 🤣
22/01/2023, 18:17 - Adam: Youot a bruise?
22/01/2023, 18:22 - Rachel: Oh good 😘 No there's no bruise surprisingly, it's just very sore 🤣
22/01/2023, 18:25 - Adam: Bloody eckers
22/01/2023, 18:25 - Rachel: I'm glad you're okay though, I took us both down with quite a bump 🤣
22/01/2023, 19:46 - Adam: Lmao 🤣
22/01/2023, 19:48 - Rachel: How's your day been, have you been up to much?
22/01/2023, 19:55 - Adam: Nah, it's been a quiet one
22/01/2023, 19:55 - Rachel: Typical Sunday then 🙈
23/01/2023, 10:25 - Rachel: ❤
23/01/2023, 10:25 - Adam: <Media omitted>
23/01/2023, 10:30 - Rachel: Did you sleep alright last night?
23/01/2023, 11:37 - Adam: Aye, fine love. Did you?
23/01/2023, 11:38 - Rachel: Oh good 😘 What time's your lesson today? Yeah fine thanks, you know me 🤣
23/01/2023, 14:54 - Adam: Friday instead
23/01/2023, 14:59 - Rachel: Oh really, why's it been changed?
23/01/2023, 16:48 - Adam: Not sure, she just messaged last night
23/01/2023, 16:49 - Rachel: Ah fair enough, at least she's rearranged it
23/01/2023, 19:59 - Adam: Yeah, gonna see if I can get a couple of hours every week
23/01/2023, 20:00 - Rachel: Oh that would be good for you 😘 Are you gonna try and add an extra day or just extend your lesson?
24/01/2023, 11:29 - Adam: Either will be fine
24/01/2023, 12:04 - Rachel: Ah yeah that makes sense, I'm sure she'll see what she can do for you
24/01/2023, 20:57 - Rachel: Do you have a small screw driver that I could borrow please? Xxx
24/01/2023, 20:58 - Rachel: <Media omitted>
24/01/2023, 21:20 - Adam: Yeah I'll see what I've got
24/01/2023, 21:21 - Adam: What are you opening?
24/01/2023, 21:21 - Rachel: Thank you 😘 It's for my kitchen scales
24/01/2023, 21:58 - Adam: 🤣🤣 bless ya
24/01/2023, 21:59 - Rachel: I'll try and remember to remind you to bring it tomorrow 🤣
24/01/2023, 22:03 - Adam: Prolly for the best 🤣
24/01/2023, 22:03 - Rachel: Yeah I thought so 🤣🙈
24/01/2023, 22:04 - Adam: Had a proper itchy eye all evening 😑
24/01/2023, 22:05 - Rachel: Oh really, I wonder why that is 🤔 Is it sore?
24/01/2023, 22:11 - Adam: Nah, just itchy
24/01/2023, 22:16 - Rachel: Oh that's odd. I'm glad it's not hurting xx
24/01/2023, 22:21 - Adam: Surprised you're still awake
24/01/2023, 22:25 - Rachel: Oh I am in bed so it probably won't be long 🤣 I got back from my Mum's at about 9 so I was just reading for a bit
24/01/2023, 22:28 - Adam: What filth are you reading?
24/01/2023, 22:31 - Rachel: Hahaha it isn't filth this time, I promise 🤣🤣 It's by Rob Beckett and Josh Widdicombe - I listen to a podcast they do about parenting, they started it during the first lockdown. And now they've turned it into a book. It's really funny, even though I'm not a parent 🤣 I only listen to it because I really like them both
24/01/2023, 22:42 - Adam: Ahhhhh that the guy with the big teeth?
24/01/2023, 22:46 - Rachel: Yeah that's him 🤣🤣 And you'll probably recognise Josh if you saw him, he's on loads of comedy shows
24/01/2023, 22:48 - Adam: <Media omitted>
24/01/2023, 22:48 - Rachel: 😘😘
24/01/2023, 23:19 - Adam: Cheeky face
24/01/2023, 23:37 - Adam: Just caught bracken trying to rip open a pack of dreamies 🤣😑
25/01/2023, 07:30 - Rachel: Hahaha they're so cheeky, you'd think they don't get fed 🤣🤣
25/01/2023, 17:05 - Rachel: Please don't forget the screwdriver 🤣
25/01/2023, 17:48 - Adam: How small is it, looks pretty small
25/01/2023, 17:55 - Rachel: Yeah it is very small
25/01/2023, 17:57 - Rachel: Do you want me to send another picture of it? Or you can look at it tonight and then just bring the screwdriver next time you come over if that's easier
25/01/2023, 18:07 - Adam: Omw
25/01/2023, 18:07 - Rachel: Okay 😘
26/01/2023, 18:30 - Adam: Who took that pic of your mam? 🤣🙅‍♂️
26/01/2023, 18:55 - Rachel: I imagine she just got a waitress to take it 🤣 Or her secret boyfriend, who knows 🤣
26/01/2023, 19:43 - Adam: 🤣🤣
26/01/2023, 19:45 - Rachel: Did you go to Morrisons earlier? We went to the cafe for tea and I'm sure I saw you come in 🤣
26/01/2023, 20:21 - Adam: No I didn't. You checking out other men? 😑😑😑🤣
26/01/2023, 20:22 - Rachel: Oh I must be, I was convinced it was you 🤣🤣🤣 Oops 🙈
26/01/2023, 22:04 - Rachel: You know that case we were talking about today with that transgender woman who raped those women? I just watched something about it on the news and she actually only started transitioning whilst awaiting the rape trial so I'll give you that one, he must have just done that to affect the sentencing 🙈
26/01/2023, 22:36 - Adam: <Media omitted>
27/01/2023, 08:00 - Rachel: 😉😘
27/01/2023, 10:46 - Rachel: <Media omitted>
27/01/2023, 10:47 - Adam: What a sausage 🤣
27/01/2023, 10:55 - Rachel: She got herself properly wrapped up in it, she looked very cosy 🤣
27/01/2023, 11:59 - Adam: Reminds of Bram's and the pillowcase
27/01/2023, 12:02 - Rachel: Aww does she sleep in your pillowcases?
27/01/2023, 12:03 - Adam: Nah she got tangled up in one at one point
27/01/2023, 12:04 - Rachel: Aww bless her 🤣 Cats are so clever but they can be so stupid sometimes 🤣🙈
27/01/2023, 18:17 - Adam: Omw 😘
27/01/2023, 18:17 - Rachel: 😘
27/01/2023, 18:22 - Adam: Cheeky face
27/01/2023, 18:23 - Rachel: 😉
28/01/2023, 15:20 - Rachel: I need to get it out so I can stop thinking about it before my night out. I just find it upsetting that you clearly don't feel as comfortable with me as I do with you. Because I've told you absolutely everything about me, good and bad. So it's either that you don't feel comfortable with me or you don't trust me, and I'm not sure which is worse
28/01/2023, 15:29 - Adam: Quite the extreme don't you think?
28/01/2023, 15:35 - Rachel: Maybe but that's the way I'm feeling, and you always tell me to tell you how I'm feeling. Because if I'm being honest, I felt this way when you didn't tell me that you were going to meet Carl. In the morning as you left, I asked you what you were doing in town and you said just getting money out so you felt like you had to hide it from me for some reason. And then the next time you came to mine, I asked you about it and you said that I always want the gossip. But I didn't want to gossip, I wanted you to talk to me about something that was upsetting you. Which you did eventually so I appreciate that
28/01/2023, 15:39 - Adam: I wasn't sure if Carl was gonna turn up.
28/01/2023, 15:41 - Rachel: Right okay, I guess that makes sense
28/01/2023, 16:35 - Rachel: Are you home now?
28/01/2023, 16:43 - Adam: I am
28/01/2023, 16:43 - Adam: Just got some chippies cooking
28/01/2023, 16:44 - Rachel: Ah good
28/01/2023, 16:45 - Adam: Excited for tonight?
28/01/2023, 16:47 - Rachel: I'm sure I will be when I'm there
28/01/2023, 17:48 - Rachel: I'm on the train now, am I alright to call you for a minute?
28/01/2023, 17:49 - Adam: Of course
28/01/2023, 18:13 - Rachel: 😘❤
28/01/2023, 18:19 - Adam: <Media omitted>
28/01/2023, 18:29 - Rachel: I just got very lost trying to find that restaurant, even with my Google maps 🤦‍♀️
28/01/2023, 18:30 - Adam: It's a skill babes
28/01/2023, 18:31 - Rachel: I am fully blaming Google maps this time though
28/01/2023, 18:35 - Adam: Mhmmmm
28/01/2023, 20:56 - Adam: Having a nice night 🤣
28/01/2023, 21:06 - Rachel: Yeah thanks! We're currently in an old man's pub until it's time to go to the deaf institute 🤣 I am so excited though 🤣 You having a good night? 😘
28/01/2023, 21:16 - Adam: Yeah it's alright, just me, Adam, Demmi and Soph in Yates 🤣
28/01/2023, 21:19 - Rachel: Getting your cheap pints in while you can? 🤣
28/01/2023, 21:19 - Adam: Indeed

27/02/2023, 17:07 - Rachel: Not too bad thanks. I've only just got home because there was an accident and moss Bank way was closed, so I went to my Mum's and then had to find a different way home. The anaesthetic has worn off but it isn't hurting yet

01/03/2023, 19:18 - Adam: Funny ain't it, oversized bits of food and they're running off
01/03/2023, 19:19 - Rachel: Yeah they're insane 🤣 And I was slightly panicking that she'd get sick from eating raw meat but animals aren't the same as humans are they? 🤣🤦‍♀️

03/03/2023, 16:12 - Rachel: Oh I was 🤣🤣 You should have seen my face when it first started and I had to read Lyndsey's thing out. I could feel the glow 🤣🙈

13/03/2023, 10:39 - Rachel: I just booked the tickets for Hamilton in when they went on sale, and you should have seen the level of stressing 🤣🙈
13/03/2023, 14:44 - Adam: Stressing thinking they'd sell out?
13/03/2023, 14:47 - Rachel: Yeah. They went on sale at 10 and I was on the website from about 9 ready to go, but when I clicked on it at 10 I was number 4738 in the queue 🤣 So there was a lot of stressing whilst I was in the queue and it was just a lot of pressure to make sure I got good tickets. I managed to get them though, it all turned out fine like it usually does 🤣🤦‍♀️
13/03/2023, 20:33 - Adam: Aww bless ya 🤣🤣

14/03/2023, 06:56 - Adam: Aww you still in bed?
14/03/2023, 06:58 - Rachel: Aww no what a nightmare 😕 Yeah that's fair enough, hopefully the weather stays okay when you walk down later. I was still in bed but I'm up now 😂 It was too cold to get up
14/03/2023, 07:00 - Adam: Need a timer for your heaters so it's ready for when you get out of bed
14/03/2023, 07:01 - Rachel: Yeah I know. My mum has that at hers but she's got central heating, I don't think mine would do that would they?
14/03/2023, 07:03 - Adam: I'll have a look
14/03/2023, 07:09 - Rachel: Thank you 😘😘 We need the weather to start getting warmer 🙄 Apparently we're getting some more snow over Easter. It was really warm last Easter, it was Easter Sunday that we had our second date when we went to the park
14/03/2023, 07:09 - Adam: It was snowing in the night

15/03/2023, 21:44 - Rachel: 12th to 14th April
16/03/2023, 09:16 - Adam: <Media omitted>
16/03/2023, 09:18 - Rachel: 😘😘
16/03/2023, 09:18 - Adam: <Media omitted>
16/03/2023, 11:29 - Adam: 🙅‍♂️
16/03/2023, 11:30 - Rachel: 🙅‍♀️
16/03/2023, 12:47 - Rachel: 😉😘
16/03/2023, 13:24 - Adam: 🤣🤣😘
17/03/2023, 09:21 - Rachel: Did you sleep any better last night? 😘
17/03/2023, 13:16 - Adam: Up and down all night 🤣
17/03/2023, 13:17 - Rachel: Aww no 🙈 At least you had a bit more than the night before 😘
17/03/2023, 18:33 - Adam: Pick us up about half 7? 😉😘😘😘
17/03/2023, 18:38 - Rachel: Okay no worries 😘
17/03/2023, 18:39 - Adam: Cheeky face
17/03/2023, 18:41 - Rachel: Moss bank way was closed earlier a couple of hours ago because of an accident so hopefully it will be open now, I'll see if I can find another way round 🤣
17/03/2023, 18:50 - Adam: No panicking
17/03/2023, 18:51 - Rachel: Never 😇
20/03/2023, 19:37 - Adam: Reckon the screen will be alright?
20/03/2023, 19:41 - Rachel: Yeah I picked it up tonight and it's fine ☺️
21/03/2023, 17:21 - Adam: Looks like rents going up, joy
21/03/2023, 17:22 - Rachel: Aww no you're joking 😢 Is it going up by a lot?
21/03/2023, 17:24 - Adam: Find out next week, his 2 yr mortgage renewals due
21/03/2023, 17:46 - Rachel: Ah yeah hopefully it's not too much, I think most landlords have put rent up this year
21/03/2023, 18:04 - Adam: Getting worse innit
21/03/2023, 18:04 - Rachel: It certainly is 🙈
22/03/2023, 18:35 - Adam: Just waiting on taxi
22/03/2023, 18:36 - Rachel: No worries
23/03/2023, 14:18 - Rachel: I've just got my bonus letter - it's normally about £1100 before tax and this year, it's £473 before tax 🙃
23/03/2023, 14:43 - Adam: Bastards
23/03/2023, 14:46 - Rachel: I know right, I knew it was gonna be less but that is such a crazy decrease. I'm not really gonna come out with anything after tax, NI and student loan. And my pay increase is 3.5% while everyone else gets 7%, so that probably won't be noticeable either. I know that I shouldn't complain because it's better than nothing and some people don't get any bonus or pay rise, it's just the principal that's annoyed me 🤣🙈 It feels like a punishment
23/03/2023, 17:10 - Adam: The shit just never ends does it?
23/03/2023, 17:11 - Rachel: That was the last time I whine about it though, I promise 🤣 I called my Mum after I got the letter and had a little rant so I'm okay now 🤣🙈
23/03/2023, 19:52 - Rachel: Did you manage to get into town?
23/03/2023, 19:52 - Adam: No, it's a lot of money that's got robbed from you all on the wrong opinion of a miserable paedo
23/03/2023, 19:55 - Rachel: You're absolutely right, that makes me feel more justified then 🤣🤣😘
24/03/2023, 21:00 - Rachel: 😘💖
24/03/2023, 21:02 - Adam: 😘😘😘
24/03/2023, 21:03 - Rachel: How are you? 😘😘
24/03/2023, 21:17 - Adam: Meh 🤣
24/03/2023, 21:19 - Rachel: Aww I thought you'd been quiet ❤
24/03/2023, 21:30 - Adam: You have a nice day?
24/03/2023, 21:31 - Rachel: Yeah it's not been too bad thanks. I was in the office today but it's usually really quiet on a Friday, I managed to get a lot done. What about you, how was your driving lesson?
24/03/2023, 21:54 - Adam: Argument with dad 🤣
24/03/2023, 22:04 - Rachel: Aww no I'm sorry 😔 What happened?
24/03/2023, 22:48 - Adam: I'll tell you about it tomoz
24/03/2023, 22:48 - Rachel: Okay no worries 😘
24/03/2023, 22:52 - Adam: How come you're still awake 🤣
24/03/2023, 22:53 - Rachel: Oh I am in bed 🤣🤣 I just kept my WiFi on so I could hear when you text me back
24/03/2023, 22:55 - Adam: You reading?
24/03/2023, 22:57 - Rachel: I was reading for a bit but I've just stopped now. What are you up to?

24/03/2023, 23:13 - Rachel: 😉😘
25/03/2023, 14:59 - Rachel: Do you want me to pick you up tonight?
25/03/2023, 15:25 - Adam: Yeah please, about 7ish okay?

31/03/2023, 22:19 - Rachel: What are you laughing at? 🤣😘
31/03/2023, 22:20 - Adam: Home so early
31/03/2023, 22:22 - Rachel: Well that's because we were just going out for a meal and I drove, this isn't me being an old lady 🤣🤣 We've planned our next catch up and we're properly going out for drinks so I won't be home this early then 🤣
31/03/2023, 22:30 - Adam: Mhmmm

31/03/2023, 23:01 - Adam: Nothing exciting 🤣
31/03/2023, 23:03 - Rachel: There's nothing wrong with that 🤣 It obviously wouldn't have been too exciting because you weren't with me 🤣😏

31/03/2023, 23:49 - Rachel: I'm watching a Selena Gomez documentary about her anxiety, it's not a very cheery show for a Friday night 🤣
01/04/2023, 00:29 - Adam: What about it? 🤣
01/04/2023, 00:31 - Rachel: It was filmed over a few years while she's preparing for tours and work things, it's mainly her having panic attacks and crying a lot 🙈 I feel really bad for her actually, I couldn't think of anything worse than being famous. I'd take the money and the travelling but that's it 🤣
01/04/2023, 00:56 - Adam: Panic attacks and crying 🤦‍♂️🤣
01/04/2023, 00:57 - Rachel: Yeah that was pretty much the whole film. You would not have enjoyed it 🤣

01/04/2023, 15:41 - Rachel: Yeah that's true. We can order something or I'm happy not to, I just wanted to check whether I need to eat before you come
01/04/2023, 15:46 - Adam: I'll eat here before I come 😘
01/04/2023, 15:48 - Rachel: Okay no worries 😘 I was planning on picking up some washing from Becca and my Mum's so I can pick you up
01/04/2023, 16:09 - Adam: What time were you thinking
01/04/2023, 16:11 - Rachel: I was thinking of setting off to theirs at about 6 ish so I'd probably be at yours for between half 6 and 7, is that okay?

02/04/2023, 18:25 - Adam: Knew there was something 🤣🤣
02/04/2023, 18:28 - Rachel: I completely forgot, I just spotted it when I was getting my litter 🤣 Do you need me to bring it to you or can you wait until Tuesday?
02/04/2023, 18:37 - Adam: Yeah I'll wait
02/04/2023, 18:38 - Rachel: No worries 😘

03/04/2023, 16:37 - Adam: I can do Wednesday, she's busted her head open, bless her 🤦‍♂️🤣
03/04/2023, 17:09 - Rachel: Wow she does not have good luck 🙈
03/04/2023, 19:19 - Adam: <Media omitted>
03/04/2023, 19:24 - Rachel: Jeeeeeez how has she done that??

04/04/2023, 13:35 - Adam: Awwwww yay, you didn't tell me it was today 🤣
04/04/2023, 13:40 - Rachel: Yeah I was so brave and strong 🤣🙅‍♀️ They originally booked 2 appointments and were going to do it in halves but he just did it all today. The most uncomfortable part was keeping my mouth open for an hour and a half 🤣🙈
04/04/2023, 15:02 - Adam: Feel better about it now?
04/04/2023, 15:10 - Rachel: Yeah much better thanks ☺️ It isn't hurting really which is good. And now I just need to get the crown and I should be done 🤞
04/04/2023, 18:32 - Adam: 40 quid in mozzas and came home with fuck all
04/04/2023, 18:33 - Rachel: Jeez it's getting worse 🙈 What did 40 quid get you?
04/04/2023, 20:13 - Adam: Shite mostly 🤣

17/04/2023, 17:54 - Rachel: Good 😘
17/04/2023, 20:37 - Adam: How's he been?
17/04/2023, 20:41 - Rachel: Yeah he seemed okay thanks, he said he's just tired. I think he's pretty nervous about it but you know what my Dad's like, he'd never say that 🤣 Just casual jokes about him dying 🤦‍♀️ He said he's gonna be in the ICU for a while afterwards and will be pretty out of it so he's gonna give us the number for the ICU just in case, and then he'll text us when he's on a ward and we can go and see him
17/04/2023, 21:49 - Adam: You still with him?
17/04/2023, 21:53 - Rachel: No he left pretty much straight after we had tea. He said that we couldn't get too close to him because he's supposed to be isolating so he was sat in the corner for most of the time and then we couldn't hug him when he was leaving 🙈
17/04/2023, 21:56 - Adam: Fucking hell
17/04/2023, 21:56 - Rachel: Yeah he kind of just gave us all an awkward scratch on our heads 🤣🤦‍♀️
17/04/2023, 22:13 - Adam: Bless him 🤣🤦‍♂️
17/04/2023, 22:21 - Rachel: He didn't know what to do with himself 🤣🤦‍♀️I think he's terrified and pretending not to be. I heard him talking to my Mum when he thought we couldn't hear, about how he's old so his body isn't strong anymore
18/04/2023, 00:58 - Adam: Any way I can help?
18/04/2023, 09:01 - Rachel: You already help just by listening to my bullshit 🤣😘 Thank you 😘❤️
18/04/2023, 13:10 - Adam: What times he heading to hospital today?
18/04/2023, 13:11 - Rachel: He's going in at 5pm today and his operation should be at 7 in the morning, they said he's the first in so that's good
18/04/2023, 15:10 - Adam: Bless him
18/04/2023, 15:11 - Adam: How you feeling?
18/04/2023, 15:17 - Rachel: I'm not too bad thanks 😘 I'm worried and I'll probably be stressing tomorrow but I'm trying not to worry too much because that isn't helpful to anyone 🙈
18/04/2023, 16:16 - Adam: You a mess, babes? 🤣😘😘
18/04/2023, 16:36 - Rachel: You know me, I'm never a mess 🤣😇😘
18/04/2023, 18:47 - Rachel: Thanks for calling 😘😘
18/04/2023, 18:54 - Adam: 🤣🤣🤣🤦‍♂️😘
18/04/2023, 18:55 - Rachel: And I only acted like we didn't know each other for a couple of minutes of the call 🤣🤣😘
19/04/2023, 12:19 - Adam: Heard anything yet, lovey?
19/04/2023, 12:28 - Rachel: No nothing yet 🙈 They said that they were taking him down at 8 this morning and it should take about 5 hours. Hopefully no news is good news 🤞
19/04/2023, 15:03 - Rachel: He's made it through the surgery, they're just getting him ready for the icu
19/04/2023, 15:13 - Adam: 😘😘
19/04/2023, 16:13 - Rachel: 😘😘
19/04/2023, 17:39 - Adam: Pick me up about half 7ish? 😘🤣
19/04/2023, 17:40 - Rachel: Yeah no worries
19/04/2023, 17:42 - Adam: 2 quid for a tube of pringles now 😡
19/04/2023, 17:44 - Rachel: Jeez 🙈
19/04/2023, 19:16 - Rachel: I'm setting off
19/04/2023, 19:16 - Adam: 😘😘
19/04/2023, 19:28 - Rachel: I'm here
20/04/2023, 14:07 - Rachel: I beeped my horn at someone on the way home for the first time in my 6 years of driving 🤣🙈
20/04/2023, 23:26 - Adam: Ohh noes, what happened love 🤣
21/04/2023, 07:02 - Rachel: A guy in a big van just started moving into my lane without looking or indicating, and very nearly hit me 🙈 It was the quietest beep you've ever heard but it got my point across 🤣
21/04/2023, 10:10 - Adam: Awww, a little toot was it 🤣
21/04/2023, 12:33 - Rachel: Yeah just a baby 'please don't crash into me' toot 🤣
21/04/2023, 14:51 - Adam: 🤣🤣🤣😘
21/04/2023, 17:19 - Rachel: 😘😘
21/04/2023, 18:01 - Adam: I'll pop round tomorrow my love, not feeling so good today 😘
21/04/2023, 18:02 - Adam: You in the car home?
21/04/2023, 18:28 - Rachel: Aww no worries, what's up? 😘 I've just got home now
21/04/2023, 21:03 - Adam: Just not been myself. 😘
21/04/2023, 21:03 - Rachel: What have you been thinking about?
21/04/2023, 23:08 - Adam: Nothing love 🤣
21/04/2023, 23:15 - Rachel: I don't believe you but sure, if you say so 🤣😘
21/04/2023, 23:16 - Adam: I promise 😘🤣
21/04/2023, 23:17 - Rachel: Okay then 😘
22/04/2023, 16:20 - Adam: How's your dad been? 😘
22/04/2023, 16:23 - Rachel: He's not too bad thanks 😘 His lungs filled with blood yesterday and collapsed so they had to drain that out and reinflate his lungs, so they're keeping him on oxygen but they think he's doing well. He sent my mum a picture of his scar earlier which she sent to us, it's huge 🙈
22/04/2023, 16:24 - Adam: Bloody hell love
22/04/2023, 16:26 - Rachel: Apparently they said that thing with his lungs is normal after this operation 🤷‍♀️ I text him last night to ask how he was and he said he was fine, I only know all this because of my Mum and Becca 🤣🤦‍♀️
22/04/2023, 18:20 - Adam: Awww you still being kept in the dark?
22/04/2023, 18:22 - Rachel: I always am 🤣🤣 It's just because he doesn't want me to worry. But my Mum and Becca will just tell me everything anyway
22/04/2023, 18:36 - Adam: Pick us up if you want, fancy going anywhere?
22/04/2023, 18:37 - Rachel: Yeah sure, where do you fancy going? I've already eaten but we can go somewhere else if you want
22/04/2023, 18:38 - Adam: Just somewhere outside, still bright out 😘
22/04/2023, 18:38 - Rachel: Yeah no worries ☺️ I'll get ready and set off then
22/04/2023, 19:02 - Rachel: I'm here
23/04/2023, 21:16 - Rachel: 😘
23/04/2023, 21:21 - Adam: 😘😘
24/04/2023, 17:00 - Rachel: Hey you okay? 😘
25/04/2023, 12:37 - Adam: Yeah, just had a shitty migraine all day 😘
25/04/2023, 12:37 - Adam: All ready for tomorrow?!
25/04/2023, 12:41 - Rachel: Aww no, are you feeling any better now? 😢😘 Yeah I think so, thank you 🙈 I went over my notes again last night and added some extra bits so I'm actually feeling kind of prepared for the individual interview. I just need to make sure I expand on my answers more than I did last time and hopefully I'll be okay. We're going seeing my Dad tonight so I'll do some last bits when I get back and then I think I'm ready to go 🙈
25/04/2023, 16:44 - Adam: You'll smash it 😘
25/04/2023, 16:47 - Rachel: Aww thank you, I'll do my best 😘😘

26/04/2023, 08:46 - Adam: My baby girl gonna kick some serious ass 😘
26/04/2023, 09:45 - Rachel: Thank you 😘😘
26/04/2023, 09:45 - Rachel: 🙅‍♀️🙅‍♀️🙅‍♀️
26/04/2023, 10:57 - Rachel: I've just finished my group interview - it was pretty much the same task as last time but for a different show, it was about Eurovision this time and you know how I feel about Eurvision 🤣 It was quite difficult though because there was 6 people in the group and I kept getting talked over a bit, but I did my best and I think I managed to get some ideas in 🙈
26/04/2023, 14:15 - Adam: They mention how rude it was to talk over you during the interview?
26/04/2023, 14:18 - Rachel: No I just made sure I got my ideas out, hopefully they saw I was being talked over. I've had my individual interview now too, so it's all done. Are you free?
26/04/2023, 15:29 - Rachel: I'm setting off
26/04/2023, 15:32 - Adam: 😘😘

27/04/2023, 20:16 - Adam: 🤣🤣🤣🤦‍♂️
27/04/2023, 20:16 - Adam: I'm sure you said you'd be ready for half 8
27/04/2023, 20:18 - Rachel: I said half 7 🤣🤣🤦‍♀️
27/04/2023, 20:18 - Adam: Oops 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤣
27/04/2023, 20:19 - Rachel: I'd expect nothing less 🤣🤣
28/04/2023, 12:52 - Rachel: The further down south we get, it is instantly getting so much brighter and warmer 😂🤦‍♀️
28/04/2023, 13:02 - Adam: Mhmm 🤣

01/05/2023, 15:39 - Adam: Bless him, how is he?
01/05/2023, 15:51 - Rachel: He still seems really fed up but I think he's doing a bit better thanks. His scar is infected but he's moving around a bit easier than the last time we saw him

06/05/2023, 00:05 - Adam: 🤣🤣🤣
06/05/2023, 00:07 - Rachel: I'll tell you about it properly later but it did not go well, it ended with me telling him to fuck off and leave us alone 😅

06/05/2023, 20:12 - Adam: Won't be happening, Adams skint it seems and demmi's been told she can't go to a pub apparently 🤦‍♂️
06/05/2023, 20:13 - Rachel: Aww that's a shame! Why can't she go to a pub, because she's pregnant?
06/05/2023, 20:15 - Adam: Another controlling dickhead it seems
06/05/2023, 20:15 - Rachel: Oh no you're joking. That's awful, why are there so many insane men? 🙈
06/05/2023, 20:17 - Adam: I have no idea
06/05/2023, 20:18 - Adam: Apparently he's out in the pub every other day
06/05/2023, 20:18 - Adam: He went watching guardians with his mate as well the other day without her
06/05/2023, 20:18 - Adam: Fkn livid for her
06/05/2023, 20:19 - Rachel: Is she the one whose last boyfriend was like that and you went round when he was there? Or is this the same guy? 

Oh God yeah, that's usually what these controlling guys do. It's okay for them to go out but not the girl
06/05/2023, 20:20 - Adam: Same girl, different feller
06/05/2023, 20:22 - Rachel: Aww that's such a shame, the last guy must have knocked her confidence down that much that she's ended up with another guy like him. I hope she doesn't stay with him, poor girl
06/05/2023, 20:23 - Adam: Exactly what I was thinking
06/05/2023, 20:23 - Adam: She was excited
06/05/2023, 20:23 - Adam: She's climbing the walls being stuck in
06/05/2023, 20:24 - Rachel: That's so sad, I feel so bad for her. Does he not let her go out at all?
06/05/2023, 21:49 - Adam: Doesn't sound like it
06/05/2023, 21:52 - Rachel: Oh that's awful, what a shame. She must feel so trapped, it will be so difficult for her to leave him
07/05/2023, 11:47 - Adam: What time were you thinking? 😘
07/05/2023, 11:48 - Rachel: Well my eye test is at half 12 so I maybe should be done at about 2? It will be around then but I'll call you when I'm finished 😘 As long as it doesn't take me an hour to choose some glasses 😂🙈
07/05/2023, 11:48 - Adam: 2 sounds good 😘
07/05/2023, 11:49 - Rachel: 😘

09/05/2023, 13:06 - Adam: Nah, she was a pissed up mess 🤦‍♂️
09/05/2023, 17:30 - Rachel: Aww bless her 🙈 Did she end up staying at yours again?
09/05/2023, 18:46 - Adam: She did 🤦‍♂️
09/05/2023, 18:47 - Rachel: Bless her 🙈 Is she alright now? I thought she'd seemed fed up from that Facebook post I showed you yesterday
09/05/2023, 19:06 - Adam: Yeah, I knew something was gonna blow up
09/05/2023, 19:06 - Rachel: Yeah you've been saying that for a while. I hope she's alright
09/05/2023, 23:09 - Adam: How's my baby girl been feeling?
10/05/2023, 07:32 - Rachel: I'm feeling a bit better thank you 😘😘 I'm gonna ring the doctor's this morning but I've managed to work through my thoughts a bit so I know what I'm feeling and it's not just a jumbled mess like it was on Monday 😂
10/05/2023, 07:57 - Adam: 😘😘 you still been anxious?
10/05/2023, 08:00 - Rachel: A bit but not as much. I haven't had any more panic attacks and I haven't cried at all since Monday, what a streak I'm on 😂
10/05/2023, 08:10 - Rachel: I've managed to get an appointment at 9.40 today which is good, sooner than I thought ☺️
10/05/2023, 12:57 - Adam: Everything alright love. Just noticed a missed call
10/05/2023, 12:58 - Rachel: That's okay, I'd just finished at the doctor's which is round the corner from yours so I was gonna see if we could go for a quick walk or something if you were in
10/05/2023, 13:05 - Adam: What did the Dr say
10/05/2023, 13:06 - Rachel: Not too much really, she thinks it's probably just anxiety but she's booked some blood tests and an ECG just in case
10/05/2023, 13:09 - Adam: Ecgs are nothing to worry about 😘
10/05/2023, 13:10 - Rachel: Oh yeah I'm sure it will be fine, thanks 😘 I've got the blood tests next Wednesday and I guess take it from there. I have to go back after I finish work later to pick a referral up or something
10/05/2023, 14:15 - Rachel: Do you want to go for a quick walk when I go to the doctor's after work? If you're not too busy
10/05/2023, 16:18 - Adam: What time lovey
10/05/2023, 16:29 - Rachel: I was gonna set off now if you're free?
10/05/2023, 16:29 - Adam: Sure 😘
10/05/2023, 16:30 - Rachel: Okay 😘
10/05/2023, 16:41 - Rachel: I'm outside
10/05/2023, 19:27 - Rachel: I've just been to see my Mum and the first thing she did was give me a piece of cake 🤣 And we had a chat
10/05/2023, 19:45 - Adam: 🤣🤣😘
10/05/2023, 19:47 - Rachel: 😘😘😘
10/05/2023, 20:44 - Adam: What did you chat about? 😘
10/05/2023, 20:51 - Rachel: Well she was asking me what I've been feeling anxious about so I told her everything that I told you and everything that I've been feeling. Because I haven't actually spoken to her at all, I didn't tell her about my doctor's appointment today or the panic attacks I've been having. And she said that if everything comes back clear, I should ask for some anxiety medication which I thought as well
10/05/2023, 21:17 - Adam: Aww bless you 😘
10/05/2023, 21:17 - Rachel: The second I walked in, she got this really concerned look on her face and said 'why is your face so pink?' So she knew straight away I'd been crying 🤣
10/05/2023, 21:32 - Adam: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
10/05/2023, 21:32 - Rachel: Can't hide it 🤣🤦‍♀️

11/05/2023, 15:24 - Rachel: Slightly is good, that means you're getting there 😘
12/05/2023, 15:55 - Adam: Films at 7:40?

04/06/2023, 19:42 - Rachel: We didn't say love you when you got out of the car 😧
04/06/2023, 21:18 - Adam: Did we not?
04/06/2023, 21:22 - Rachel: I don't think so, we were distracted making sure that you got your stuff 🙈 Love you 🤣😘❤️
04/06/2023, 22:09 - Adam: Oh noes, love you 🤣😘
05/06/2023, 07:30 - Rachel: 😘😘
05/06/2023, 20:37 - Rachel: I've had my swim with Carl 🤣
05/06/2023, 21:47 - Adam: Ohh aye? 🤣
05/06/2023, 21:48 - Rachel: Yeah it was great, we were in there for about an hour and a half 😂
05/06/2023, 22:19 - Adam: Mhmmm 🤣🤣😘
05/06/2023, 22:19 - Rachel: 🤣🤣😘
06/06/2023, 12:27 - Rachel: I'm going to my Mum's for tea tonight so I'll pick you up on my way home. I'll text you when I'm setting off 😘
06/06/2023, 15:50 - Adam: What time 😘
06/06/2023, 16:09 - Rachel: I'm not too sure yet, maybe around 8 ish but I'll let you know 😘
06/06/2023, 19:12 - Rachel: I'm setting off
06/06/2023, 19:14 - Adam: Okie doke
06/06/2023, 19:19 - Rachel: I'm here
06/06/2023, 20:02 - Rachel: <Media omitted>
07/06/2023, 13:54 - Rachel: That all came out completely wrong, I'm so sorry. I wasn't saying that I don't want a future with you - it's because I so badly want a future with you that I felt like we needed to talk about it. Since I met you, I've been happier than I ever have been in my life. I love you so much and I'm really scared that I've lost you now x
08/06/2023, 17:51 - Adam: I'm not ignoring you, I'm just working through my thoughts
08/06/2023, 19:09 - Rachel: Yeah that's fine. I need to go to the chemist tomorrow after I finish work to pick up my tablets so I'll come to yours afterwards, and we can go for a walk and talk
09/06/2023, 17:01 - Rachel: I'm setting off now, I just need to go to the chemist and then drop some cat food off at my Mum's
09/06/2023, 17:09 - Adam: Okie doke
09/06/2023, 17:50 - Rachel: I'm outside
10/06/2023, 11:56 - Rachel: <Media omitted>
10/06/2023, 12:30 - Adam: 🤣 I caught bracken sprawled out in the bath yesterday like it was her bed
10/06/2023, 12:33 - Rachel: Aww bless her 🤣 Cats are little oddballs aren't they 🙈
10/06/2023, 17:46 - Adam: Was getting in for a shower and she was just chilling 🤣
10/06/2023, 17:51 - Rachel: Bless her, they're little nightmares 🤣🤣 Maybe she was trying to find somewhere to cool down 😂
10/06/2023, 17:51 - Adam: Sun was shining on her 🤣🤣🤦‍♂️
10/06/2023, 17:52 - Rachel: Oh maybe not then 🤣🤣🤦‍♀️
10/06/2023, 18:34 - Adam: She moved before I could take a pic
10/06/2023, 18:42 - Rachel: Yeah they always do don't they? 🙈 Blossom moved right after I took that picture, it probably wasn't very comfortable 🤣
10/06/2023, 20:36 - Adam: <Media omitted>
10/06/2023, 21:09 - Rachel: What am I looking at? 😂
10/06/2023, 21:53 - Adam: Just Dom being Dom 🤣🤦‍♂️
10/06/2023, 21:59 - Rachel: I didn't even notice that was Dom 🤣🤣🤦‍♀️ Where is he off to? 😂
10/06/2023, 22:18 - Adam: Guessing the flash is out
10/06/2023, 22:19 - Rachel: Ah yeah that makes sense, they're probably doing something at the cinema
11/06/2023, 00:14 - Adam: Doesn't give a fuck does he? 🤣
11/06/2023, 09:00 - Rachel: Not at all, we should all be more like Dom.🤣🤣
11/06/2023, 13:29 - Rachel: <Media omitted>
11/06/2023, 13:30 - Adam: Awwww looks good 🤣😍
11/06/2023, 13:40 - Rachel: Thank you! 😘😘😘 We spent hours yesterday setting up and we're just about finishing now. The party hasn't even started yet and I am knackered 🤣
11/06/2023, 13:40 - Adam: Nervous? 😘
11/06/2023, 13:57 - Rachel: Yeah a little bit, we're both getting a bit stressed about hosting the games 🙈
11/06/2023, 15:25 - Adam: Bless you, you'll be reet
11/06/2023, 16:35 - Rachel: Yeah it's going well so far, everyone seems to be enjoying themselves ☺️
11/06/2023, 17:28 - Adam: Worrying for nowt? 🤣😘
11/06/2023, 17:50 - Rachel: I dunno, that doesn't sound like me 🤣🤣
11/06/2023, 18:32 - Rachel: Are you gonna be in later? I'm going to Becca's for a bit and I want to quickly stop on you on my way home 😘
11/06/2023, 19:13 - Adam: What time lovey
11/06/2023, 19:16 - Rachel: I'll text you when I'm leaving Becca's if that's okay?
11/06/2023, 19:20 - Adam: Sure
11/06/2023, 20:41 - Rachel: I'm setting off now, I just need to drop my Grandma off
11/06/2023, 20:45 - Adam: Okie doke
12/06/2023, 09:49 - Adam: Sweaty bapcheek weather again
12/06/2023, 12:04 - Rachel: Beautifully put 🤣🤣 Yeah it's so nice, I'm in the office today so I'm outside on my lunch hour
12/06/2023, 12:26 - Rachel: Are you free? I want to vent at you for a sec 🤣😘
12/06/2023, 15:39 - Adam: Phone was upstairs, what's up love
12/06/2023, 18:07 - Rachel: <Media omitted>
12/06/2023, 19:01 - Adam: Oiii noiii
12/06/2023, 19:03 - Rachel: I know, it was nice while it lasted 🤣 I've had to set up my own account - I've got one for £4.99 a month with adverts, instead of £10.99. Which is so cheeky but I can cope with adverts to save £6 a month 🙈
12/06/2023, 20:09 - Adam: The bullshit never ends does it
12/06/2023, 20:13 - Rachel: I know, it's so ridiculous 🤣 Considering there are so many streaming services now, they're very above their station
13/06/2023, 04:28 - Adam: Can't sleep, so sweaty 🤣🤣🤦‍♂️
13/06/2023, 06:32 - Rachel: Oh I know, it is so sweaty 🙈 I've still got my Mum's fan so we can put that on when you come over
13/06/2023, 22:01 - Rachel: <Media omitted>
13/06/2023, 22:17 - Adam: 🤣🤣🤣
13/06/2023, 22:26 - Rachel: Hopefully it will still be there for you tomorrow 🤣🙈
13/06/2023, 23:39 - Adam: Take it you didn't get fly spray 🤣
14/06/2023, 07:31 - Rachel: No I forgot, I'll have to get some next time I go shopping 🤣 But the issue is that the spiders might fall on me after I spray them because they're on the ceiling 🙈
14/06/2023, 10:46 - Rachel: <Media omitted>
14/06/2023, 12:16 - Adam: Awwww

16/06/2023, 14:14 - Rachel: Someone's finally been round about the water marks from that leak 🥳🥳
16/06/2023, 16:32 - Adam: They painted it?
16/06/2023, 16:45 - Rachel: No he just took some pictures so he can see what paint he needs to get 🤣🙈
16/06/2023, 16:47 - Adam: Bramble just got shouted at by a magpie
16/06/2023, 16:49 - Rachel: Aww bless her, I bet that shocked her 🙈
16/06/2023, 16:50 - Adam: Landed on the wheelie bins and gave her a load of shit
16/06/2023, 16:51 - Rachel: Was she even doing anything to it?
16/06/2023, 17:13 - Adam: Nope 🤣🤣
16/06/2023, 17:13 - Rachel: Aww bless her, abused for no reason 🤣

18/06/2023, 22:00 - Adam: 😘
20/06/2023, 12:07 - Rachel: I had my first meeting with Gemma this morning about my new plan and it was brutal 🙃
20/06/2023, 14:44 - Adam: Ohh love, what happened
20/06/2023, 15:21 - Adam: I feel like complete shit, only had a couple of hours last night
20/06/2023, 17:32 - Rachel: Urgh I'll tell you about it properly when you come over but it was even worse than I expected 🙈 

Aww no I'm sorry 😢😘

21/06/2023, 18:10 - Rachel: How did you get on? 😘

21/06/2023, 19:53 - Adam: <Media omitted>
21/06/2023, 19:55 - Rachel: Aww that's a shame but at least you've got something. Are you going to apply for the apprenticeship? It's good that it's a level 2, I know that's what you were saying you needed so you'll be able to get plastering jobs at the end of it
22/06/2023, 14:15 - Rachel: Are you in this afternoon? I'm at my work's away day in town today and I want to quickly stop on you on my way home if that's okay? It will be about 4 ish
22/06/2023, 20:37 - Adam: Feeling better?
22/06/2023, 20:39 - Rachel: Yeah I'm feeling a bit better thank you 😘 I feel exhausted, I'm gonna have to get an even earlier night than normal 🤣 xxx
23/06/2023, 16:00 - Rachel: What time do you want to meet for a coffee in town tomorrow? The train is at 4.25
23/06/2023, 18:11 - Adam: What time did you fancy?
23/06/2023, 18:45 - Rachel: Erm maybe 2? We can have a couple of hours before we need to go for the train
23/06/2023, 18:46 - Adam: Was thinking 2ish as well
23/06/2023, 18:47 - Rachel: Great 😘 The same place as last time?
23/06/2023, 20:46 - Adam: Of course 😘

25/06/2023, 22:40 - Adam: Awful
26/06/2023, 08:17 - Rachel: Don't forget to apply for the apprenticeship today, you pinky promised me 🤣😘
27/06/2023, 09:11 - Rachel: Are you okay? You've been very quiet
27/06/2023, 13:42 - Adam: Nah, feel shit tbh
27/06/2023, 16:12 - Adam: I can't come 'round tonight. I'm not a very nice person to be around today. Please don't be upset, and enjoy your poetry night. 😘 Love you
27/06/2023, 16:13 - Rachel: Yeah that's fine, I understand. It will have to just be Saturday then if that's okay? Love you too
27/06/2023, 16:46 - Rachel: 😘
27/06/2023, 17:19 - Adam: 😘😘
28/06/2023, 09:05 - Rachel: How are you feeling today?
28/06/2023, 14:13 - Adam: 🙃
28/06/2023, 14:13 - Rachel: Aww no still not feeling good? 😢
28/06/2023, 14:16 - Rachel: I'm going to my Mum's for tea tonight, I could stop on you on my way home? I won't stay long but seeing your face always makes me feel better when I'm sad 😘 I'm just assuming that mine does the same for you, it might not 🤣🙈
28/06/2023, 14:54 - Adam: 🤣🤣 cutie
28/06/2023, 14:56 - Rachel: I'm gonna take that as a yes 😉 I'll text you when I'm setting off 😘
28/06/2023, 15:17 - Adam: What time
28/06/2023, 15:19 - Rachel: Maybe 7/8? I probably won't stay at my Mum's too late because I need to pack for my retreat tomorrow and I've got a job interview tomorrow morning which I need to go to before the retreat 🙈
28/06/2023, 19:18 - Rachel: I'm setting off
29/06/2023, 04:23 - Adam: Can't sleep, kick some ass tomorrow 😘
29/06/2023, 07:31 - Rachel: Aww no 😢

29/06/2023, 10:29 - Rachel: All done! It was the most chilled interview ever, we were just sat on a couch having a chat and then went on a tour of the gym 😂
29/06/2023, 13:25 - Adam: 🤣🤣🤦‍♂️
29/06/2023, 13:31 - Rachel: I feel like it was okay though, she said she'll let me know this weekend 🤞
29/06/2023, 13:44 - Adam: Christ that's quick

10/07/2023, 16:33 - Adam: How did it go?
10/07/2023, 16:34 - Rachel: Yeah it was okay actually, I may have stressed prematurely 🤣 She was nice about it, she said she's sorry I'm leaving but she said I'll be really good on front reception and she thinks it will be good for me. So that's okay 😂
10/07/2023, 20:28 - Adam: You're funny 🤣🤣

14/07/2023, 17:23 - Rachel: Absolutely not, what can you do? 🤣 I was just annoyed that I had to get out of bed and get ready early for no reason 🤣
14/07/2023, 17:27 - Rachel: I just asked my mum if my profile picture looked alright because I felt like I looked like I had a lazy eye and she said 'it's not your most flattering photo' 🤣 I can always count on my Mum to be honest 🤣 xxx
14/07/2023, 17:29 - Rachel: So you need to heart the new one too 🤣😘
14/07/2023, 17:31 - Adam: No smile 🤣
14/07/2023, 17:32 - Rachel: Yeah I think it's the big grin which made me look like I had the lazy eye 🤣 So I've gone for sultry this time, have I nailed it? 🤣 I'm not good at being sexy 🙈
14/07/2023, 17:35 - Adam: Tremendously 🤣😘
14/07/2023, 17:36 - Rachel: That sounds sarcastic 🤣 You're supposed to say 'You're always sexy'
14/07/2023, 17:49 - Adam: Someone's very self conscious lately 🤣😘😘
14/07/2023, 17:51 - Rachel: Me, never 🤣🙈 This isn't an exaggeration, I took 50 photos until I found one where I didn't hate my face 🤣🤦‍♀️
14/07/2023, 17:54 - Adam: Ohhh Rach 😘
14/07/2023, 17:54 - Rachel: Do I look acceptable in the one that I settled on? 🤣 It doesn't make you embarrassed to have me as your girlfriend? 🤣😘
14/07/2023, 19:16 - Rachel: <Media omitted>
14/07/2023, 19:24 - Adam: 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🫠 where's that come from, drink more please 🤣
14/07/2023, 20:30 - Rachel: That was just me thinking I'm not good at being sexy 🤣🤣

Also, I am very drunk 🙃
14/07/2023, 20:55 - Adam: Good girl
14/07/2023, 21:17 - Rachel: I think we both needed this 🤣 We're gonna find somewhere else to go for a drink now
14/07/2023, 21:28 - Rachel: I'm so happy that your friends have added me to your group chat. They do like me 🤣🤣
14/07/2023, 21:46 - Adam: Ohh dear 🤣
14/07/2023, 21:53 - Rachel: I have no idea what anyone's talking about 🤣
14/07/2023, 21:59 - Rachel: <Media omitted>
14/07/2023, 22:01 - Adam: <Media omitted>
14/07/2023, 22:45 - Rachel: We're setting off now, I'll ring you when I get home 😘
14/07/2023, 22:47 - Adam: That it? 🤣
14/07/2023, 22:52 - Rachel: Yeah Rena's ready for bed, she's been in the office all day 🤣 And I was struggling to stand waiting for the taxi 🙈
14/07/2023, 23:34 - Rachel: I wish you were here 😉😘
14/07/2023, 23:37 - Adam: <Media omitted>
14/07/2023, 23:37 - Rachel: 😘😘😘
14/07/2023, 23:42 - Rachel: Using buzz just isn't the same without you anymore 🤣😘
15/07/2023, 00:40 - Adam: Cheeky
15/07/2023, 07:31 - Rachel: <Media omitted>
15/07/2023, 15:16 - Adam: Fuck is this rain again
15/07/2023, 15:16 - Rachel: I know right, it's horrendous 🙈🙈
15/07/2023, 18:13 - Adam: Grotesque
15/07/2023, 18:13 - Rachel: I hope it's not like this all day tomorrow 🤣🙈
15/07/2023, 18:17 - Adam: Weeks of this shit by the sounds of it
15/07/2023, 18:17 - Rachel: British summer 🙄
15/07/2023, 18:29 - Adam: Just waiting on taxi
15/07/2023, 18:29 - Rachel: No worries 😘
16/07/2023, 18:56 - Rachel: The fake tooth I had fitted a few years ago has just fallen out 🙃
16/07/2023, 19:01 - Rachel: <Media omitted>
16/07/2023, 21:16 - Adam: Ohhh Babba
16/07/2023, 21:17 - Adam: Just no luck lately 🤣😘
16/07/2023, 21:18 - Rachel: I know right, there's always something 🤣 I have no idea how it happened, I was just eating one of those brownies and it literally just fell out 🙈 I'm gonna ring the dentist first thing and try and get an urgent appointment. I can't start my new job looking like this 🤣
16/07/2023, 21:22 - Adam: Bloody odd that.  No more smiles from you? 🙃🤣😘
16/07/2023, 21:22 - Rachel: I know, it's so weird 🤣 Nope, only a grumpy face until it is fixed
16/07/2023, 21:23 - Rachel: <Media omitted>
16/07/2023, 21:24 - Adam: 🤣🤣
16/07/2023, 21:25 - Rachel: I immediately video called my Mum and had somewhat of a flap 🙃
16/07/2023, 22:17 - Adam: Awwww bless, what did you say 🤣😘
17/07/2023, 07:51 - Rachel: I think it was something along the lines of 'MUM MY TOOTH JUST FELL OUT' and then started showing it to her 🤣 She said they should just be able to put it back in
17/07/2023, 08:43 - Adam: Yea they will. But bless you🤗😘🤣
17/07/2023, 09:51 - Rachel: Got an appointment tomorrow morning so at least I'm not seeing anyone today 🤣

How are you? 😘
17/07/2023, 11:17 - Adam: I'm okay, just been evil weather again
17/07/2023, 11:18 - Rachel: Oh I know, it's horrendous 🙈 We were so lucky yesterday
17/07/2023, 15:52 - Adam: How's the tooth? 🤣😘
17/07/2023, 15:53 - Rachel: It feels so weird 🤣 I was on the phone to my Mum earlier and I was lisping 🙈
17/07/2023, 15:53 - Adam: Ohhh no 🤣
17/07/2023, 15:54 - Rachel: I've honestly never been sexier 🤣😘 Hopefully they can sort it tomorrow 😂
17/07/2023, 15:59 - Adam: Feeling delicate love? 🤣
17/07/2023, 15:59 - Rachel: Yeah you should have seen me after it fell out last night 😂🙈 And I barely slept because I was worrying about it 🤣
17/07/2023, 22:16 - Rachel: <Media omitted>

18/07/2023, 15:19 - Adam: Sounds expensive 🫠🙃
18/07/2023, 15:28 - Rachel: Ooh yep, that's gonna be another £300 🙃
18/07/2023, 15:51 - Rachel: I'll probably be earlier than 9 tonight if that's okay? Becca and Nate are in the hospital and we're looking after Isaac so I'll probably set off when my Mum's putting him to bed. Maybe just after 7 😘
18/07/2023, 16:38 - Adam: Won't be able to do tonight, I've got the shits 🤣😫🫠🤦‍♂️
18/07/2023, 16:40 - Rachel: Oh no 🙈 Do you want to stay tomorrow night after the cinema if you're feeling better and I'll make sure you're back for your driving lesson on Thursday?
18/07/2023, 16:40 - Adam: That'd be for the best, yes 🤣🤣🤣😘😘
18/07/2023, 16:41 - Rachel: Yeah that's fine 🤣🤣 Are you still okay to come with me tomorrow to take my stuff to AXA if you're feeling better?
18/07/2023, 16:41 - Adam: And thank you, lesson is at 2-2:30ish
18/07/2023, 16:41 - Adam: Of course
18/07/2023, 16:41 - Adam: How's the tooth been?
18/07/2023, 16:43 - Rachel: Thank you so much 😘 I'll see if I can carry it into the car but if I can't, I might have to bring you to mine to put it in the car before we set off if that's okay please? 🙈 

And the tooth's fine thanks 😘 I'm just making sure I don't eat on that side 🤣
18/07/2023, 16:56 - Adam: Strong independent woman
18/07/2023, 16:56 - Rachel: 🙅‍♀️🙅‍♀️🙅‍♀️🙅‍♀️🙅‍♀️
18/07/2023, 19:01 - Rachel: Gemma said that I need to drop my stuff off between 11 and 2 tomorrow so I'll pick you up at 12 if that's okay?
19/07/2023, 07:55 - Adam: Sure
19/07/2023, 08:45 - Rachel: How are you feeling today?
19/07/2023, 11:47 - Rachel: I'm setting off

23/07/2023, 14:37 - Rachel: Aww no 🙈 Has the roller thing you've got not helped?
23/07/2023, 14:40 - Adam: A little bit, then it wears off 🤣
23/07/2023, 14:41 - Rachel: Oh no 😕 Do you think you should go to the doctor? I can drive you
23/07/2023, 17:36 - Adam: Bless you 🤣 it's just a pulled muscle love. Needs time that's all
23/07/2023, 17:37 - Rachel: Oh no worries 😘 I'll just have to keep giving you massages until it heals 🤣😉
24/07/2023, 17:42 - Rachel: <Media omitted>
24/07/2023, 18:13 - Adam: 🤣🤣😘
24/07/2023, 18:20 - Rachel: You're not supposed to laugh at my love 🤣😘

25/07/2023, 23:02 - Adam: Was in my spam, how dare
25/07/2023, 23:03 - Rachel: My messages are spam to you?!

26/07/2023, 06:40 - Rachel: Aww no I'm sorry 🙈😘 Hopefully you can get back to sleep for a bit. Or drink lots of tea!
26/07/2023, 13:46 - Rachel: Can I please be a massive pain and ask you to print that document off again? 🙈 They said they can't accept it because I didn't include my middle name on it and I need to take a picture rather than scanning it, even though they didn't say that in the email 🙃
26/07/2023, 14:30 - Adam: Printed out
26/07/2023, 14:31 - Rachel: Thank you, you're my hero 😘 I'm gonna set off in a sec

28/07/2023, 09:34 - Adam: 🤣😘
28/07/2023, 09:38 - Rachel: He's also said that he'll screw that loose vent back in the bathroom so that might help with my spider problem 🤣🤣
28/07/2023, 10:13 - Adam: Ohh forgot to tell you, apparently peppermint oil is good for keeping spiders away
28/07/2023, 10:15 - Rachel: Oh I'll have to see if I can get some of that, thank you!
28/07/2023, 10:15 - Rachel: <Media omitted>
28/07/2023, 10:35 - Adam: 🤣🤣
28/07/2023, 10:37 - Rachel: I thought about asking the painter to get rid of him for me but he's only tiny so I can cope 🤣
28/07/2023, 21:02 - Rachel: I just watched Happiness for Beginners and I really enjoyed it, those reviewers know nothing 🤣
28/07/2023, 21:08 - Adam: 🤣🤣🤦‍♂️
28/07/2023, 21:09 - Rachel: I'm easily pleased 🤣
28/07/2023, 21:13 - Adam: Fucking not 🤣
28/07/2023, 21:15 - Rachel: Hahaha how rude 🤣 You don't know how lucky you are to have such a low maintenance girlfriend 😇
28/07/2023, 21:19 - Adam: Mhmmmm 🤣
28/07/2023, 21:21 - Rachel: Completely chilled at all times 🤣
29/07/2023, 02:22 - Adam: Blurp
29/07/2023, 08:33 - Rachel: Blurp 😘
29/07/2023, 10:01 - Rachel: It's gonna be dry today, can we please go for one of our walks? 😘
29/07/2023, 16:23 - Rachel: I'm setting off. Don't forget to bring whatever you'll need for tomorrow 😘
30/07/2023, 20:00 - Rachel: Can I please be really annoying and ask you to print something else off for me? 🙈 This isn't for work
30/07/2023, 20:01 - Adam: What is it
30/07/2023, 20:03 - Rachel: http://www.selfhelpguides.ntw.nhs.uk/northumbria/leaflets/selfhelp/Anxiety.pdf

I don't know if it will let you print it off, the PDF isn't opening on my phone
30/07/2023, 20:20 - Adam: I'll have a look after
30/07/2023, 20:20 - Rachel: No worries, thank you so much 😘
30/07/2023, 21:20 - Rachel: You don't need to print that thing off anymore, it's let me open it now. Plus it's 36 pages so you don't want to print that 🤣 Thanks though 😘
31/07/2023, 23:23 - Adam: Fucking weather
01/08/2023, 09:54 - Rachel: Urgh I know, it was horrific yesterday 🙈 Apparently we're supposed to have a heatwave from the middle of August so we can look forward to that 🤣
01/08/2023, 22:59 - Adam: Gotten your start date yet, cheeky face? 😘
01/08/2023, 23:01 - Rachel: Fingers crossed it should all be finalised tomorrow 🤞😘 The screening people have got everything they need from me now so Emma's hoping to get me in on a shadow shift on Friday, she just needs them to send me my login details for the system which should hopefully be tomorrow 🙈🤣
01/08/2023, 23:03 - Adam: Aww good
01/08/2023, 23:03 - Rachel: How's your day been? 😘
01/08/2023, 23:04 - Adam: Migraine for most of it 🤣
01/08/2023, 23:06 - Rachel: Aww no 😔 Are you feeling alright now?
02/08/2023, 04:33 - Adam: Thunder and pissing it down again 🤦‍♂️
02/08/2023, 08:30 - Rachel: Just a couple more weeks until the apparent heatwave 🤣🙈
02/08/2023, 15:53 - Adam: Can't cope with it
02/08/2023, 15:54 - Rachel: I know, this has been the worst summer ever 😫
02/08/2023, 15:56 - Adam: Wettest on record for greater manchester
02/08/2023, 15:56 - Rachel: What a delight 🤣🤣

02/08/2023, 19:04 - Rachel: 😂
02/08/2023, 20:59 - Rachel: Catherine's asked us to get to hers for about 4 on Saturday so I'm thinking I'll pick you up at 2 so we can have a bit of time together before we go if that's okay?
02/08/2023, 21:46 - Adam: Mhmm
03/08/2023, 08:45 - Rachel: Are you feeling any better today?
03/08/2023, 10:00 - Adam: Cheeky face 😘
03/08/2023, 10:02 - Rachel: Are you trying to be nice to me now after so cruelly rejecting me last night? 🤣😉😘
03/08/2023, 10:12 - Rachel: You know I was joking then right, that came across? 🤣🙈
03/08/2023, 10:18 - Adam: Ohh dear, stop flapping 🤣🤣😘
03/08/2023, 10:18 - Rachel: Yeah it's way too early for flapping 🤣🤣🤦‍♀️
03/08/2023, 10:26 - Adam: Uh oh, up all night worrying? 🤣
03/08/2023, 10:28 - Rachel: Not all night 🤣 Just as I was going to sleep and then first thing when I woke up this morning
03/08/2023, 10:36 - Adam: 🤣🤣😘

03/08/2023, 10:38 - Rachel: I've just had a bad couple of days anxiety and overthinking wise 🙈 I love how you could tell that just from my text, you know me so well 🤣😘
03/08/2023, 10:50 - Adam: What are you overthinking
03/08/2023, 10:53 - Rachel: Well I was overthinking the fight we had on Saturday and still thinking about the insecurities I was having. And then when you didn't come over last night, I took that to me that you're sick of me and didn't want to see me 🙃
03/08/2023, 11:06 - Adam: Thought so 🤣🤣😘😘
03/08/2023, 11:27 - Rachel: And you were just laughing away 🤣🤣😘
03/08/2023, 17:48 - Adam: Such a sausage

04/08/2023, 17:00 - Adam: Aww bless you 🤣😘
04/08/2023, 17:02 - Rachel: I've had a couple of angry people but it's nothing I can't handle 🤣💪 xxx
04/08/2023, 17:03 - Adam: Old cunts?
04/08/2023, 17:06 - Rachel: Yeah it was mainly just people who have had money taken but don't think they should have but one of the other girls took the calls. There was one guy who's called every day so they girls knew who he was as soon as I said his name 😂
04/08/2023, 17:07 - Adam: Lonely fucker
04/08/2023, 17:08 - Rachel: Definitely 😂 Most people have been really nice though, they seem to know a lot of the members pretty well xxx
